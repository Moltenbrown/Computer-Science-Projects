I can provide the new implementation of the UPPair to my original clients without breaking them or requiring them to alter the code. I implemented my code using an interface IUPPair and an abstract class, AbstractUPPair. My original implementation required that if something wasn't an empty uppair, it's through the exception, but otherwise, it would create a new UPPair from the username and password. By commenting out this portion of the code, regardless of whether it is an empty set or not, it will create a new UPPAir from the entered username and password.  The implementation is the same as before, it just does something different.
