## General issues
* -5 Maven does not build

## Problem 1
* It is better to have separate classes for Color and Velocity as well.

* -2 An OO design should have separate class for each vehicle (moto, auto and busTruck), which extends the abstract vehicle class and implements the behaviors declared in the interface.


## Problem 2
* -1 A good design should have an interface for ParkingLot where parkVehicle should be declared.

## Problem 3
* It is still suggested to have an interface of publication even if it is an empty interface for now.

Well Done!
