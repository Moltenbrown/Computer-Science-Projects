## General issues - 10 points
 - Nice job with Javadoc
 - Warning: please pay attention to your checkstyle, Find bugs and PMD reports. It is easy to fix these things,
 and it really does improve the quality of your code (-1 point)
 - Warning: many of your tests are failing, making it impossible to build your project (-2 points)

## Problem 1 (Bag of Words) - total points 20
	- Immutable 
	- Defines the required methods correctly
	- Defines methods equals(), hashCode 
	- UML diagram
	- Tests do not compile (-1 point)

## Problem 2 (Mutable Queue) - total points 20
	- Nice job with the mutable approach
	- Nicely defined methods equals(), hashCode 
	- Nice job with the required methods
			- Warning: your methof remove does not allow multiple instance of the same element to all be removed.
	- UML diagram

## Problem 3 (Mutable Deque) - total points 25
	- Nice job with the mutable approach
	- Nice job with methods equals(), hashCode
	- The required methods implemented correctly
	- Implementation for both LIFO and FIFO Deques - it apprears that your complete implementation
	is handled by your abstract class, but that's not quite the optimal design (-2 points)
	- Proper implementation for the required exception
	- UML diagram 
	- Appropriate tests

## Problem 4 (Soccer Team) - total points 25
	- Does not appear that you attempted it
