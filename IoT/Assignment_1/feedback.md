Some quick feedback: 

* Try to include your sketch files in Github as well. 
* Might also be helpful to include your fritzing diagrams and such as well; then you have all the files there to edit and recreate the build. 
* Good comment on where you got your code. 
* Nice wildcard build. I like how you chose to use the photosensor to try to sense what the human eye can't sense. Nice working with the PWM to change the LED intensity. 
* And you get to work with shift register this week!! 
* Your writeups look good. You don't need to note how many wires you use to wire things up. 
* Get the ## files out of your github repo :)
