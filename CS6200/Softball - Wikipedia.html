*Softball* is a game similar to baseball
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball> played with a larger ball (11
to 12 in. circumference) on a field that has base lengths of 60 feet, a
pitcher's mound that ranges from 35–43 feet away from home plate, and a
homerun fence that is 220 feet away from home plate.^[1] <#cite_note-1>
^[2] <#cite_note-2> It was invented in 1887 in Chicago
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago>, Illinois
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois>, United States
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States> as an indoor game. The
game moves at a faster pace than traditional baseball. There is less
time for the base runner to get to first while the opponent fields the
ball; yet, the fielder has less time to field the ball while the
opponent is running down to first base. The name /softball/ was given to
the game in 1926, because the ball used to be soft, however in modern
day usage, the balls are hard.

A tournament held in 1933 at the Chicago World's Fair
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_of_Progress> spurred interest in
the game. The Amateur Softball Association
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_Softball_Association> (ASA) of
America (founded 1933) governs the game in the United States and
sponsors annual sectional and World Series championships. The World
Baseball Softball Confederation
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Baseball_Softball_Confederation>
(WBSC) regulates rules of play in more than 110 countries, including the
United States and Canada; before the WBSC was formed in 2013, the
International Softball Federation
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Softball_Federation> filled
this role. Women's fast pitch softball became a Summer Olympic sport
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games#List_of_Olympic_sports>
in 1996, but it and baseball were dropped from the 2012 Games; they will
be reinstated for the 2020 Games.

There are three types of softball. In the most common type, *slow-pitch
softball*, the ball, which can measure either 11 or 12 inches in
circumference depending on gender and league, must arch on its path to
the batter, and there are 10 players on the field at once. In *fastpitch
softball <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastpitch_softball>*, the pitch
is fast, there are nine players on the field at one time, and bunting
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunt_(baseball)> and stealing bases
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stealing_(baseball)> are permitted.
*Modified softball* restricts the "windmill" wind-up usually used by
fastpitch pitchers <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher>, although the
pitcher is allowed to throw as hard as possible with the restricted back
swing. Softball rules vary somewhat from those of baseball. Two major
differences are that the ball must be pitched underhand—from 46 ft
(14 m) for men or 43 ft (13.1 m)^[3] <#cite_note-:0-3> for women as
compared with 60.5 ft (18.4 m) in baseball—and that seven innings
instead of nine constitute a regulation game.^[4] <#cite_note-4>

Despite the name, the ball <#Ball> used in softball is not soft. It is
about 12 in (about 30 cm) in circumference (11 or 12 in for slow-pitch),
which is 3 in (8 cm) larger than a baseball
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_(ball)>. Softball recreational
leagues for children use 11-inch balls until they participate in travel
ball around age 12 and adjust to a 12-inch sized ball. The infield in
softball is smaller than on an adult or high school baseball diamond
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_field> but identical to that
used by Little League Baseball
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_League_Baseball>; each base is
60 ft (18 m) from the next, as opposed to baseball's 90 ft (27 m). In
fast pitch softball the entire infield is dirt, whereas the infield in
baseball is grass except at the bases and on the pitcher's mound which
are dirt. Softball mounds are also flat, while baseball mounds are a
small hill. Softballs are pitched underhand, but baseballs are pitched
overhand. This changes the arc of the ball when approaching the plate.
For example, depending if the pitcher pitches a fastball, in softball
the ball would most likely rise while in baseball because the pitcher is
on a hill, the ball would drop.

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Indoor-baseball.JPG>
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Indoor-baseball.JPG>
Indoor baseball player, 1907

The earliest known softball game was played in Chicago
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago>, Illinois on Thanksgiving
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanksgiving> Day, 1887. It took place at
the Farragut Boat Club at a gathering to hear the outcome of the Yale
University <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale> and Harvard University
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard> football
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football> game.^[5]
<#cite_note-5> When the score was announced and bets were settled, a
Yale alumnus threw a boxing glove at a Harvard supporter. The Harvard
fan grabbed a stick and swung at the rolled up glove.^[6] <#cite_note-6>
George Hancock, a reporter there, called out "Play ball!" and the game
began, with the boxing glove tightened into a ball, a broom handle
serving as a bat. This first contest ended with a score of 41–40.^[7]
<#cite_note-ISF_History-7> The ball, being soft, was fielded
barehanded.^[8] <#cite_note-CHM-8> ^[9] <#cite_note-9>

George Hancock <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Hancock_(softball)>
is credited as the game's inventor for his development of a 17" ball and
an undersized bat in the next week. The Farragut Club soon set rules for
the game, which spread quickly to outsiders. Envisioned as a way for
baseball <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball> players to maintain
their skills during the winter, the sport was called "Indoor
Baseball".^[10] <#cite_note-Sports_Encyclopedia-10> Under the name of
"Indoor-Outdoor", the game moved outside in the next year, and the first
rules were published in 1889.^[10] <#cite_note-Sports_Encyclopedia-10>

In 1895 Lewis Rober, Sr. of Minneapolis
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis,_Minnesota> organized outdoor
games as exercise for firefighters
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefighter>;^[11] <#cite_note-11> this
game was known as kitten ball (after the first team to play it), lemon
ball, or diamond ball.^[12] <#cite_note-12> Rober's version of the game
used a ball 12 inches (30 cm) in circumference, rather than the 16-inch
(41 cm) ball used by the Farragut club, and eventually the Minneapolis
ball prevailed, although the dimensions of the Minneapolis diamond were
passed over in favor of the dimensions of the Chicago one. Rober may not
have been familiar with the Farragut Club rules. Fire Station No. 19
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_Station_No._19_(Minneapolis,_Minnesota)>
in Minneapolis, Rober's post from 1896 to 1906, was listed on the
National Register of Historic Places
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places> in
part for its association with the sport's development.^[13]
<#cite_note-13> The first softball league outside the United States was
organized in Toronto <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto> in 1897.

The name "softball" dates back to 1926. The name was coined by Walter
Hakanson of the YMCA
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Men%27s_Christian_Association>^[7]
<#cite_note-ISF_History-7> at a meeting of the National Recreation
Congress.^[14] <#cite_note-Inventions_and_Discoveries-14> (In addition
to "indoor baseball", "kitten ball", and "diamond ball", names for the
game included "mush ball", and "pumpkin ball".^[7]
<#cite_note-ISF_History-7> ) The name softball had spread across the
United States by 1930.^[14] <#cite_note-Inventions_and_Discoveries-14>
By the 1930s, similar sports with different rules and names were being
played all over the United States and Canada. By 1936, the Joint Rules
Committee on Softball had standardized the rules and naming throughout
the United States.^[15] <#cite_note-15>

Sixteen-inch softball <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16-inch_softball>,
also sometimes referred to as "mush ball" or "super-slow pitch"
(although the ball is not soft at all) , is a direct descendant of
Hancock's original game. Defensive players are not allowed to wear
fielding gloves. Sixteen-inch softball is played extensively in
Chicago,^[16] <#cite_note-16> where devotees such as the late Mike Royko
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Royko> consider it the "real"
game,^[17] <#cite_note-17> and New Orleans. In New Orleans, sixteen-inch
softball is called "Cabbage Ball" and is a popular team sport in area
elementary and high schools.

By the 1940s, fastpitch began to dominate the game. Although slow pitch
was present at the 1933 World's Fair
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1933_World%27s_Fair>, the main course of
action taken was to lengthen the pitching distance. Slow pitch achieved
formal recognition in 1953 when it was added to the program of the
Amateur Softball Association
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_Softball_Association>, and within
a decade had surpassed fastpitch in popularity.^[10]
<#cite_note-Sports_Encyclopedia-10>

The first British women's softball league was established in 1953.^[10]
<#cite_note-Sports_Encyclopedia-10>

In 1991, women's fastpitch softball was selected to debut at the 1996
Summer Olympics
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996_Summer_Olympics>.^[7]
<#cite_note-ISF_History-7> The 1996 Olympics also marked a key era in
the introduction of technology in softball. The IOC funded a landmark
biomechanical study on pitching during the games.

In 2002, sixteen-inch slow pitch was written out of the ISF official
rules, although it is still played extensively in the United States
under The Amateur Softball Association of America
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Softball>, or ASA rules.

The 117th meeting <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/117th_IOC_Session> of
the International Olympic Committee
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee>, held in
Singapore <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore> in July 2005, voted
to drop softball and baseball <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball>
as Olympic sports <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_sports> for the
2012 Summer Olympic Games
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Summer_Olympic_Games>, but will be
back in the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo.^[18]

    Overview[edit
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Softball&action=edit&section=2>]

Fastpitch softball is played between two teams on a large field, with
nine players from one team on the field at a time. Slow-pitch softball
is played with ten fielders. The field is usually composed of a dirt or
brick-dust infield <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infield> that contains
the quadrilateral shape, and running areas, of a diamond, and a grass
outfield <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfield>. However, the field
can consist of other solid and dry surfaces such as artificial turf or
asphalt. There are four bases
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softball#The_field> on the infield (first
base <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_base>, second base
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_base>, third base
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_base>, and home plate
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_plate>); the bases are arranged in a
square and are typically 45 to 65 feet (14 to 20 m) apart. Near the
center of this square is the pitcher's circle
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softball#The_field>, and within the
circle is the "rubber", a small flat rectangular piece of rubber about a
foot and a half in length. The rubber can be 40 or 43 feet away from
home plate, depending on age level and the league one is playing in.

The object of the game is to score more runs <#Scoring_runs> (points)
than the other team by batting
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(baseball)> (hitting) a ball into
play and running around the bases, touching each one in succession. The
ball is a sphere of light material, covered with leather or synthetic
material. It is 10 to 12 inches (25–30 cm) (or, rarely, 16 in or
41 cm^[19] <#cite_note-chicagopedia-19> ) in circumference. The game is
officiated by one or more neutral umpires
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umpires>. Players and umpires are
generally free to ask for a brief stoppage at any time when the ball is
not in play (called a time out), or immediately following a play once
its outcome is clear.

The game is played in usually seven innings
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings>. Each inning is divided into a
top half <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning#Baseball>, in which the
away team bats and tries to score runs, while the home team occupies the
field and tries to record three outs
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_(baseball)>; then a bottom half
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning#Baseball>, when the teams' roles
are reversed. Some leagues play with a reduced number of innings or with
a time limit, rather than the traditional seven innings.

To start play, the offense sends a batter
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batter_(baseball)> to home plate
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_plate>. The batting order
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(baseball)> must be fixed
at the start of the game, and players may not bat out of turn. The
defense's pitcher <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher> stands atop
the rubber and throws ("pitches
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)>") the ball towards home
plate using an underhanded motion. In slow-pitch, the pitcher must have
both feet in contact with the pitching rubber at all times. In
fastpitch, the pitcher is allowed to take one step back prior to
releasing the ball during the forward movement. The batter attempts to
hit the pitched ball with a bat
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_bat>, a long, round, smooth
stick made of wood <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood>, metal
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal> or composite
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_material>. If the pitcher
throws three strikes <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_(baseball)>
against a batter, then the batter is out and the next batter in the
order comes up to bat. A strike is recorded any time a batter swings at
and misses a pitch or when a batter hits a ball foul
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foul_ball> (out of play). A strike is
also recorded any time the batter does not swing at a pitch
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)> that crosses home plate
within an area known as the strike zone
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_zone>. To be within the strike
zone, the pitch must cross over home plate, and as it crosses it must be
above the knees and slightly below the shoulders (roughly the armpit or
the shirt logo). The strike zone therefore varies from batter to batter.
A pitch outside the strike zone is a ball
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_(baseball_statistics)>. If the
batter reaches four balls, the batter is awarded the first base in what
is known as a "walk". The umpire behind home plate is the sole arbiter
of balls and strikes. A foul ball may or may not result in a strikeout
dependent upon what association and local league rules. However, bunting
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunt_(baseball)> a foul ball does result
in a strikeout. In some associations and leagues, bunting is not allowed
and results in an out. Also, if a player has two strikes, swinging and
partially hitting the ball can result in an out if the catcher manages
to catch the tipped ball.

The batter attempts to swing the bat and hit the ball fair
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_ball> (into the field of play).
After a successful hit the batter becomes a baserunner
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baserunner> (or runner
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runner>) and must run to first base. The
defense attempts to field <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_field>
the ball and may throw the ball freely between players, so one player
can field the ball while another moves to a position to put out the
runner. The defense can tag <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_out> the
runner, by touching the runner with the ball while the runner is not on
a base. The defense can also touch first base while in possession of the
ball; in this case it is sufficient to beat the batter to first base and
an actual tag of the batter is unnecessary. A runner is said to be
"thrown out" when the play involves two or more defensive players.
Runners generally cannot be put out when touching a base, but only one
runner may occupy a base at any time and runners may not pass each
other. When a ball is batted into play, runners generally must attempt
to advance if there are no open bases behind them; for example, a runner
on first base must run to second base if the batter puts the ball in
play. In such a situation, the defense can throw to the base that the
lead runner is attempting to take (a force out
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_play>), and the defense can then
also throw to the previous base. This can result in a multiple-out play:
a double play <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_play> is two outs,
while a triple play <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_play>, a very
rare occurrence, is three outs. Runners with an open base behind them
are not forced to advance and do so at their own risk; the defense must
tag such runners directly to put them out rather than tagging the base.

A ball hit in the air and caught before hitting the ground, in fair or
foul territory, puts the batter out. A fly ball is a ball hit high and
deep, a pop fly <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_fly> is a ball hit
high but short, and a line drive
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_drive> is a ball hit close to the
horizontal. After the catch, runners must return to their original
bases; if the defense throws the ball to that base before the runner
returns, the runner is out as well, resulting in a double play. A runner
who remains on the base until the ball is touched, or returns to the
base (tags up <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_up>) after the catch,
may try to advance to the next base, at the risk of being tagged out
between bases. As in baseball, the infield fly rule
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infield_fly_rule> applies in some game
situations to prevent the defense from recording multiple force outs by
deliberately dropping an easy catch.

Offensive strategy is mostly just to hit the ball skillfully to let the
batter reach base and advance other runners around the bases to score
runs. The count of balls and strikes indicates how aggressive the batter
should be. The offense may try to sacrifice
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrifice>, with the batter deliberately
making an out in order to advance runners. Defensive strategy is more
complex, as particular situations (number of outs and positions of
baserunners) and particular batters call for different positioning of
fielders and different tactical decisions. The defense may decide to
allow a run if it can achieve one or multiple outs.


    Playing field[edit
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Softball&action=edit&section=3>]

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Softball_diamond_large.png>
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Softball_diamond_large.png>
Diagram of a softball diamond

The playing field is divided into 'fair territory' and 'foul territory'.
Fair territory is further divided into the 'infield', and the
'outfield', and the territory beyond the outfield fence.

The field is defined by 'foul lines' that meet at a right angle at 'home
plate'. The minimum length of the baselines varies classification of
play (see below for official measurements). A fence running between the
baselines defines the limits of the field; distance from home plate to
the fence varies by field.

Behind home plate is a 'backstop'. It must be between 25 and 30 feet
(7.62 and 9.14 meters) behind home plate depending on the type of
division that is playing.

'Home Plate' is one corner of a diamond with 'bases' at each corner. The
bases other than home plate are 15 in (38 cm) square, of canvas or a
similar material, and not more than 5 in (13 cm) thick. The bases are
usually securely fastened to the ground. The bases are numbered counter
clockwise as first base, second base, and third base. Often, but not
always, outside first base (that is, in foul territory) and adjacent and
connected to it, there is a contrast-colored "double base" or "safety
base". It is intended to prevent collisions between the first baseman
and the runner. The runner runs for the foul portion of the double base
after hitting the ball while the fielding team tries to throw the ball
to the regular first base before the runner reaches the safety base.
However, not all softball diamonds have these safety bases and they are
much more common in women's softball than in men's. The double base is
required in ISF championships
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISF_Junior_Women%27s_World_Championship>.

The infield consists of the diamond and the adjacent space in which the
infielders (see below) normally play. The outfield is the remaining
space between the baselines and between the outfield fence and the
infield. The infield is usually "skinned" (dirt), while the outfield has
grass in regulation competitions.

Near the center of the diamond is the pitching plate. In fastpitch, a
skinned circle 16 feet (4.88 meters) in diameter known as the pitching
circle is around the pitching plate.^[20] <#cite_note-rules-20>

A field is officially required to have a warning track between 15 and 12
feet (5 and 4 meters) from the outfield fence. However, if the game is
being played on a field larger than required, no warning track is
required before the temporary outfield fencing.

Located in foul territory outside both baselines are two 'Coach's
Boxes'. Each box is behind a line 15 feet (5 meters) long located 12
feet (3 meters) from each baseline.

    Equipment[edit
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Softball&action=edit&section=7>]

Equipment required in softball includes a ball, a bat (composite, metal
or wooden), gloves, uniforms and protective gear: for example, helmets
for the offensive team and a helmet, shin guards and chest protector for
the defensive catcher. Also cleats, sliding shorts, face masks, chest or
heart protector, and knee sliders may be worn for softball.


      Ball[edit
      <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Softball&action=edit&section=8>]

Despite the sport's name, they are not soft at all. The size of the ball
varies according to the classification of play; the permitted
circumferences in international play are 12±0.125 in (30.5±0.3 cm), in
mass <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass> between 6.25 and 7.0 oz
(177–198 g) in fastpitch; 11±0.125 in (27.9±0.3 cm), mass between 5.875
and 6.125 oz (166.6–173.6 g) in slow pitch. For comparison, under the
current rules of Major League Baseball, a baseball has a mass between 5
and 5 ^1 ⁄_4 ounces (142–149 g), and is 9 to 9 ^1 ⁄_4 inches
(229–235 mm) in circumference (2 ^7 ⁄_8 –3 in or 73–76 mm in
diameter).^[22] <#cite_note-22> A 12-inch circumference ball is
generally used in slow pitch, although in rare cases some leagues
(especially recreational leagues) do use a 14-inch circumference ball.
Some balls have a raised seam, and others do not. The ball is most often
covered in white or yellow leather in two pieces roughly the shape of a
figure-8 and sewn together with red thread, although other coverings are
permitted. The core of the ball may be made of long fiber kapok
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceiba_pentandra>, or a mixture of cork
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cork_(material)> and rubber
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber>, or a polyurethane
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyurethane> mixture, or another
approved material.^[20] <#cite_note-rules-20>

In 2004, high-visibility yellow "optic" covering, long-used for
restricted flight balls in co-ed recreational leagues, became standard
for competitive play. Yellow is the color of official NCAA and NAIA
softballs. Yellow softballs are fast becoming the standard for all
levels of play for girls' and women's play in particular. White balls
are also allowed, but are very uncommon in slow pitch and fastpitch.

In Chicago <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago>, where softball was
invented, it remains traditional to play with a ball 16 inches (41
centimeters) in circumference. The fielders do not wear gloves or
mitts.^[23] <#cite_note-Sharon_Kennedy_Wynne-23> A 16" softball when new
is rough and hard, with hand and finger injuries to fielders frequent if
they do not "give" when receiving a ball,^[24] <#cite_note-24> but the
ball "breaks in" slightly during a game and continues to soften over
time with continued play. A well-broken-in ball is called a mush ball
and is favoured for informal "pick-up" games and when playing in limited
space, such as a city street (because the ball does not go as far). A
16-inch ball is also used for wheelchair softball.


      Bat[edit
      <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Softball&action=edit&section=9>]

The bat used by the batter can be made of wood, aluminum, or composite
materials such as carbon fiber. Sizes may vary but they may be no more
than 34 inches (86 cm) long, 2.4 inches (6 cm) in diameter, or 38 ounces
(1.1 kg) in mass <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass>.^[25]
<#cite_note-Softball-World.org-25> The standard bat barrel diameter for
both slowpitch and fastpitch softball is 2​^1 ⁄_4  inches. Many players
prefer a smaller barrel, which reduces mass and allows higher swing
speed. Although there are a variety of bats used, there are several that
are banned due to performance enhancement. These bats are determined to
be illegal by the Amateur Softball Association of America. Several bats
are banned because of the harm it may place upon other teams and/or
giving them an unfair advantage. For example, with a thinner wall,
players are able to swing the bat faster, which allows the ball to go
faster, harder, and further. Major League Softball, played at
Recreational Parks, include a variety of teams; Men's, Women's, Co-Ed.
Each League has its own specific regulations with bats, but most must be
approved by the Amateur Softball Association. Many bats may be
"doctored" or "juiced" in a sense that they are end loaded, shaved and
or painted. End loading of a cap refers to the addition of weight
manually placed at the end of the barrel to distribute more weight at
the tip. Shaving bats require machine use in order to remove the inner
walls of the bat to improve elasticity.^[26] <#cite_note-26> Lastly,
painting bats is done because competitors purchase "illegal" bats that
are dangerous and hazardous to the opposing team. These three "doctored"
and "juiced" techniques are banned from Leagues, but are still done today.


      Gloves[edit
      <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Softball&action=edit&section=10>]

All defensive players wear fielding gloves, made of leather or similar
material. Gloves have webbing between the thumb and forefinger, known as
the "pocket". No part of the glove is allowed to be the same color as
that of the ball, including that of its seams. Pitchers are also not
allowed to have any white on their gloves including the seams. It is up
to the umpire's discretion if he or she believes that any coloring on
the glove interferes with or hinders the batter from seeing the ball
clearly. Gloves used in softball are usually larger than the ones used
in baseball. No glove larger than 14 in (36 cm) can be used in ASA
(American Softball Association) sanctioned play. There are different
size gloves for different positions on the field. For example, catchers
and 1st baseman have what is called a mitt, whose pockets are larger
than other gloves. The catcher's glove has extra padding in it and does
not have finger holes. The 1st baseman's glove also has extra padding,
but with finger holes. An outfielder's glove is smaller than the
catcher's, typically 13 inches to 14 inches, but large enough to give
extra reach in catching a fly ball. An infielder's glove is the
smallest, typically from 11 inches to 13 inches. Its small size allows
faster removal of a caught ball in order to throw with the other hand. A
pitcher's glove can be of any size, but should be large enough to cover
the ball, so that the batter cannot see the pitcher's grip on the ball.


      Uniform[edit
      <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Softball&action=edit&section=11>]

Each team wears a distinctive uniform. The uniform may include a cap or
visor, a shirt, tight sliding undershorts (optional), knee length socks,
and pants; these are the components for which standards are set. The
team is required to have all of its members wear the same uniform.^[20]
<#cite_note-rules-20>

Caps, visors, and headbands are optional for female players, and have to
be the same color. Caps are mandatory for male players. A fielder who
chooses to wear a helmet (see below) is not required to wear a cap.^[20]
<#cite_note-rules-20>

Many female players use "sliding shorts", otherwise known as compression
shorts in other sports. These shorts help to protect the upper thigh
when sliding into a base. "Sliders" may also be worn for similar
protection. These are somewhat padded shinguards that extend usually
from the ankle to the knee of the wearer and wrap all the way around the
leg(s). They protect the shin, calf, etc. from getting bruised or
damaged while sliding into homeplate and make it much more comfortable
to slide into the plate. Most male players use long, baseball-style
pants. However, some female players now wear a shorter version of
baseball pants.

At the back of the uniform, an Arabic numeral from numbers 0 through 99
must be visible. Numbers such as 02 and 2 are considered identical.
Also, on the back of the uniforms players' names are optional.^[20]
<#cite_note-rules-20>

All players are required to wear shoes. They may have cleats or spikes.
The spikes must extend less than 0.75 in (19 mm) away from the sole.
Rounded metal spikes are illegal, as are ones made from hard plastic or
other synthetic materials. High school athletes are sometimes permitted
to wear metal cleats, such as in Ohio.^[27] <#cite_note-Ohio-27>

Many recreational leagues prohibit the use of metal cleats or spikes to
reduce the possible severity of injuries when a runner slides feet-first
into a fielder. At all youth (under 15) levels, in co-ed (the official
terminology for mixed teams) slow pitch, and in modified pitch, metal
spikes are usually not allowed.


      Protective equipment[edit
      <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Softball&action=edit&section=12>]

A helmet must have two ear flaps, one on each side. Helmets and cages
that are damaged or altered are forbidden. Helmets must be worn by
batters and runners in fastpitch. Helmets are optional in slowpitch. In
NCAA fastpitch softball you have the option to wear a helmet with or
without a face mask. Most female travel ball teams for fastpitch
softball require the batter to wear a helmet with a face mask. In male
fastpitch masks are generally only used for medical reasons. In
fastpitch, the catcher must wear a protective helmet with a face-mask
and throat protector, shin guards and body protector. Shin guards also
protect the kneecap.^[20] <#cite_note-rules-20>

In slow pitch, the catcher must wear a helmet and mask at youth levels.
At adult levels, there is no formal requirement for the catcher to wear
a mask, although the official rules recommend it. A female catcher may
optionally wear a body protector in slow pitch.^[20] <#cite_note-rules-20>

There is an option to wear a face mask on the field. It is recommended
in lower age groups.

In any form of softball, any player (other than fastpitch catchers on
defense) can wear a protective face mask or face guard. As usual, it
must be in proper condition and not damaged, altered, or the like.^[20]
<#cite_note-rules-20> This is intended to prevent facial injuries.^[28]
<#cite_note-Market_Wire-28> "Baseball and softball are the primary
causes of severe sports-related eye injury in Indiana and in most over
state." (Ronald Davis, M.D., professor of ophthalmology at Indiana
University)^[29] <#cite_note-29>


    Umpires[edit
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Softball&action=edit&section=13>]

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Counter_for_softball_and_baseball.jpg>
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Counter_for_softball_and_baseball.jpg>
The plate umpire often uses an indicator (sometimes called a clicker or
counter) to keep track of the game

Decisions about plays are made by umpires
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umpires>, similar to a referee
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referee> in American football
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football>. The number of umpires
on a given game can range from a minimum of one to a maximum of seven.
There is never more than one "plate umpire"; there can be up to three
"base umpires", and up to a further three umpires positioned in the
outfield. Most fastpitch games use a crew of two umpires (one plate
umpire, one base umpire).

Official umpires are often nicknamed "blue", because of their uniforms –
in many jurisdictions, most significantly ISF, NCAA and ASA games,
umpires wear navy blue slacks, a light powder blue shirt, and a navy
baseball cap. Some umpires wear a variant of the uniform: some umpires
in ASA wear heather gray slacks and may also wear a navy blue shirt;
umpires from the USSSA
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Specialty_Sports_Association>
wear red shirts with grey slacks; National Softball Association
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Softball_Association> (NSA)
umpires wear an official NSA white-colored umpire shirt with black pants
or black shorts; NSA fastpitch umpires wear the white NSA umpires shirt
and heather gray slacks.

Decisions are usually indicated by both the use of hand signals, and by
vocalizing the call. Safe calls are made by signaling with flat hands
facing down moving away from each other, and a verbal call of "safe".
Out calls are made by raising the right hand in a clenched fist, with a
verbal call of "out". Strikes are called by the plate umpire, who uses
the same motion as the out call with a verbal call of "strike". Balls
are only called verbally, with no hand gesture. The umpire also has the
option of not saying anything on a ball. It is understood that when he
stands up, the pitch was not a strike. Foul balls
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foul_ball> are called by extending both
arms up in the air with a verbal call of "foul ball", while fair balls
are indicated only by pointing towards fair territory with no verbal
call. No signal is given for balls that are obviously foul and for
closer calls that are not borderline; a mere acknowledgement signal is
given.

All decisions made by the umpire(s) are considered to be final. Only
decisions where a rule might have been misinterpreted are considered to
be protestable. At some tournaments there might be a rules interpreter
or Tournament Chief Umpire (TCU) (also known as the Umpire In Chief, or
UIC) available to pass judgment on such protests, but it is usually up
to the league or association involved to decide if the protest would be
upheld. Protests are never allowed on what are considered "judgment
calls" – balls, strikes, and fouls.


    Gameplay[edit
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Softball&action=edit&section=14>]

A softball game can last anywhere from 3 to 7 /innings/, or 1–2 hours
depending on the league, rules, and type of softball; however 7 innings
is the most common. In each inning, each team bats until three batters
have been put out (see below).^[30] <#cite_note-30> The teams take turns
batting. Officially, which team bats first is decided by a coin
toss,^[20] <#cite_note-rules-20> although a league may decide otherwise
at its discretion. The most common rule is that the home team bats
second. Batting second is also called "last at-bat". Many softball
players prefer to bat second because they feel they have more control in
the last inning, since they have the last at-bat.

In the event of a tie, extra innings are usually played until the tie is
broken except in certain tournaments and championships. If the home team
is leading and the road team has just finished its half of the seventh
inning, the game ends because it is not necessary for the home team to
bat again. In all forms of softball, the defensive team is the /fielding
team/; the offensive team is /at bat/ or /batting/ and is trying to
score runs.


      Pitching[edit
      <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Softball&action=edit&section=15>]

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pitching_3.jpg>
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pitching_3.jpg>
Fastpitch pitcher Megan Gibson
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megan_Gibson> pitching the ball in the
"windmill" motion

Play often, but not always, begins with the umpire saying "Play Ball".
After the batter is ready and all fielders (except the catcher) are in
fair territory at their respective positions, the pitcher stands at the
pitching plate and attempts to throw the ball past the batter to the
catcher behind home plate. The throw, or pitch, must be made with an
underarm motion: the ball must be released below the hip when the hand
is no farther from the hip than the elbow to get it in the strike zone.

For fastpitch softball, the traditional pitching style is a "windmill"
motion, extending the arm over the body and releasing the ball at about
hip level at maximum speeds. Strength acquired in the underhand windmill
motion is based from the open to close hip motion. Without correct form
and hip movement, pitches can be inaccurate and can lose strength and
speed. In girls' fastpitch, 12u up to 18u level can throw between 30 mph
and 65 mph, or more. Speed is not always the most important factor in
fastpitch softball. Pitchers can throw balls that curve inwards
(screwball) and outwards (curveball) on right-handed batters. Curves may
be thrown on the outside or off of the plate or inside off the plate
moving into the strikezone. There are also riseballs that break upwards
frequently starting in the strikezone and ending above it. Riseballs may
be thrown low in the zone and move higher in the zone or even below the
zone and move into it. Drop balls and drop curves (to cause the batter
to miss or hit groundballs; this is important at the higher levels where
strikeouts occur less often). The other common pitches are change-up and
fastballs. A change of pace (off-speed) is also very important, good
pitchers will be able to throw all their pitches at varying speeds and
possibly even different pitching motions. Pitchers use deception as a
primary tactic for getting batters out as the reaction times are
approximately half a second or less.

The pitcher throws the ball in or around the "strike zone". However, in
advanced play pitcher and catcher play a psychological game trying to
get the batter to guess where the next pitch is going and if it will be
a strike. In other instances, such as when an extremely powerful hitter
comes up to bat and they are followed by a weaker hitter, a pitcher may
deliberately walk the first batter based on the calculation that the
next batter will be an easy out. The strike zone is slightly different
in different forms of softball. A pitch that passes through that zone is
a "strike". A pitch that the batter swings at is also a strike, as is
any hit ball that lands in foul territory.

A pitch which is not a strike and which the batter does not swing at is
known as a "ball". The number of balls and strikes is called the
"count". The number of balls is always given first, as 2 and 1, 2 and 2,
and so on. A count of 3 and 2 is a "full count", since the next ball or
strike will end the batter's turn at the plate, unless the ball goes foul.

There is also an illegal form of pitching known as "crow-hopping". A
"crow hop" occurs when the pitcher pushes with the pivot foot from
somewhere other than the pitching plate. This often involves jumping
from the pitching plate and replanting somewhere in front of the
pitching plate. The umpire sticks his left arm out straight to the side
and clenches his fist. This results in a ball being awarded to the
batter, and any runners on base advancing to the next base. If the
batter swings at the pitch that is deemed illegal and puts the ball in
play, the defense is given the option to accept the results of the play
or accept the penalty listed previously. Image to the right demonstrates
a legal pitch as the push-off foot has not left the ground. The ball
must be released simultaneously with the lead leg step.

In fastpitch softball, there are various types of pitches. Some are: the
fastball, changeup, dropball, riseball, screwball, curveball, dropcurve,
dropchange.

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:SlowpitchTarget.jpg>
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:SlowpitchTarget.jpg>
The target used in slowpitch softball. A pitched ball must hit either
the base or the black carpet behind it to count as a strike

In 16-inch softball, as well as a number of varieties of slow pitch, the
pitch is lobbed so that the ball rises above the batter's head and lands
on either the plate itself or a small rectangular area on the ground
behind the plate. (These restrictions make it much easier to put the
ball into play and extremely difficult to use pitching as a defensive
strategy, as the physics of projectile motion
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projectile_motion> limit how fast a ball
can be thrown under such conditions and still be called a strike to a
speed much slower than a traditionally thrown ball.) Umpires will make
calls based on where the ball lands behind the plate. A pitch in "the
well" (pictured) is considered a perfect pitch. In other varieties of
slow pitch (sometimes known as "modified"), the only restriction is that
the windmill cannot be used; thus the pitching arm cannot be raised
above the shoulder and both the wind-up and the release must be
underhand, still allowing for moderate speed and control in pitching.

At higher levels of play, pitchers aim for the inner and outer corners
of the plate when throwing fastballs and moving pitches. Pitchers also
vary the location of the pitch by height to make hitting the ball even
harder for the individual up at bat. Similarly, both the dropball and
the riseball are pitches that change heights. To the batter, the
dropball appears to be coming in level but then as the ball reaches the
plate, the pitch drops, trying to force the batter to hit the top of the
ball. This should result in the batter missing or hitting a groundball.
When pitchers throw riseballs, batters see the ball coming in straight,
but as the ball approaches the plate, it rises. Frequently the purpose
of the riseball is to have the batter attempt to chase a ball which ends
up out of the strikezone and is either missed entirely or hit as an easy
pop-fly. Another pitch that breaks at the last minute is the curveball.
When pitchers throw curveballs they snap their wrist and follow their
arm across their body, making the ball curve to the outside of the
plate. There is also something called the inside curve where ball start
off the plate on the inside and curves into the strikezone. The inside
curve is frequently thrown at the batters hands so as to jam them
forcing a foul hit. Pitchers can also make the ball curve or screw to
the inside of the plate. The one pitch that drastically changes speed is
the changeup, disrupting the batter's timing. Pitchers also throw
knuckle balls which are generally slower and move erratically.

Fastpitch pitches may reach high speeds; At the 1996 Summer Olympics
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996_Summer_Olympics> one pitch reached
73.3 miles per hour (118 kilometers per hour).^[31]
<#cite_note-pitching_speed-31> Male pitching can reach speeds around 85
miles per hour (137 kilometers per hour). To compare, MLB players
average around 90 mph but can reach speeds up to 100 mph.^[32]

      Batters[edit
      <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Softball&action=edit&section=16>]

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Softball_batter_vh.jpg>
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Softball_batter_vh.jpg>
A batter swings at a pitch

The offensive team sends one "batter" at a time to home plate to use the
bat to try to hit the pitch forward into fair territory. The order the
players bat in, known as the "batting order", must stay the same
throughout the game. Substitutes and replacements must bat in the same
position as the player they are replacing. In co-ed, male and female
batters must alternate.

The batter stands facing the pitcher inside a "batter's box" (there is
one on each side of the plate to compensate for either right or left
handed batters). The bat is held with both hands, over the shoulder, and
away from the pitcher (90 degree angle). The ball is usually hit with a
full swinging motion in which the bat may move through more than 360
degrees. The batter usually steps forward with the front foot, the body
weight shifts forward, as the batter simultaneously swings the bat. A
bunt <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunt_(baseball)> is another form of
batting. There are different types, including a sacrifice bunt
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrifice_bunt>, or slap bunt
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slap_bunt>. There is also regular
slapping in which a batter takes position on the left side of the plate
and usually stands in the back of the box, but it is possible form
anywhere. The batter takes a step back with their leading foot as the
pitcher is in the middle of the windup, crosses over with their back
foot and runs toward first base while they swing. There are many
different types of slapping and they all vary depending on the batter
and their strengths. There are half swing slaps, fake slaps, and full
swing slaps. Each type of slap has a different purpose or goal. No
matter what way the batter hits the ball, they /must/ be inside the
batter's box when the bat makes contact with the ball. If the batter
steps out of the box while swinging, the batter is out.

Once the ball is hit into fair territory the runner must try to advance
to first base or beyond. While running to first base, the batter is a
"batter-runner". When she safely reaches first (see below) she becomes a
"base-runner" or "runner".

A batted ball hit high in the air is a "fly ball". A fly ball hit upward
at an angle greater than 45 degrees is a "pop fly". A batted ball driven
in the air through the infield at a height at which an infielder could
play it if in the right position is a "line drive". A batted ball which
hits the ground within the diamond is a "ground ball". If a batted ball
hits a player or a base, it is considered to have hit the ground.

A batter can also advance to first if hit by the pitch. If a batter is
hit by the pitch it is a dead ball and she is rewarded first base. She
must make an attempt to get out of the way and it is the umpire's
judgmental call whether the batter attempted to move. If he feels the
batter could have moved and avoided getting hit he or she will not
reward the batter first base and the pitch will be recorded as a ball.


      Getting the batter out[edit
      <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Softball&action=edit&section=17>]

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:UT_softball_2007.jpg>
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:UT_softball_2007.jpg>
The Texas Longhorns <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Longhorns>
softball team gets a strikeout against Penn State
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penn_State_University> to end the game,
February 15, 2008.

The batter is out if: three strikes are called (a "strikeout"); a ball
hit by the batter is caught before touching the ground (a "flyout"); the
batter goes to a base that is already tagged ("tagged" or "tag play"); a
fielder holding the ball touches a base which is the only base towards
which the batter may run before the batter arrives there (a "force out"
or "force play"); or in certain special circumstances. There is also a
not so common occurrence when the batter has 2 strikes and swings at
strike three. If the catcher doesn't catch the ball, the batter has the
chance to run to first base and the catcher can throw the batter out at
first base.


      Advancing around the bases[edit
      <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Softball&action=edit&section=18>]

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Tagget_out.jpg>
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Tagget_out.jpg>
A player trying to avoid a tag at third base.

If the player hits the ball and advances to a base without a fielding
error or an out being recorded, then that is called a "base hit". The
bases must be reached in order counterclockwise, starting with first
base. After hitting the ball the batter may advance as many bases as
possible. An advance to first base on the one hit is a "single", to
second base is a "double", to third base is a "triple", and to home
plate is a "home run". Home runs are usually scored by hitting the ball
over the outfield fence, but may be scored on a hit which does not go
over the fence. A home run includes any ball that bounces off a fielder
and goes over the fence in fair-territory (depending upon association
and local league rules) or that hits the foul pole. If a batted ball
bounces off a fielder (in fair territory) and goes over the fence in
foul territory, or if it goes over the fence at a location that is
closer than the official distance, the batter is awarded a double
instead.^[33] <#cite_note-autogenerated1982-33>

If a runner becomes entitled to the base where another runner is
standing, the latter runner must advance to the next base. For example,
if a player hits the ball and there is a runner on first, the runner on
first must try to advance to second because the batter-runner is
entitled to first base. If the batter reaches first base without being
put out, then that player can then be forced to run towards second base
the next time a ball is driven into fair territory. That is because the
player must vacate first base to allow the next batter to reach it, and
consequently can only go to second base, where a force out may be
recorded.^[33] <#cite_note-autogenerated1982-33>

Runners may advance at risk to be put out: on a hit by another player;
after a fly ball has been caught, provided the player was touching a
base at the time the ball was first touched or after; or (in fastpitch)
automatically, when a pitch is delivered illegally.^[33]
<#cite_note-autogenerated1982-33>

Runners advance without liability to be put out: when a walk advances
another player to the runner's current base; or automatically in certain
special circumstances described below.^[34] <#cite_note-34>


        Special circumstances[edit
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Softball&action=edit&section=19>]

If there is a "wild throw" (or "overthrow") in which the ball goes out
of the designated play area, each runner is awarded two bases from the
last base touched at the time of the throw. Retreating past a made base,
negates the advance to that base. If a fielder intentionally carries a
ball out of play, two bases are awarded from the time the ball leaves
the field of play. If this is unintentional (fielder's momentum), the
award is one base. If on a tag play, the fielder loses control (after
establishing control) of the ball and it leaves the field of play, one
base is awarded.^[33] <#cite_note-autogenerated1982-33>

If there is a "wild pitch" in which the ball goes out of the designated
play area, each runner is awarded one base from the base occupied at the
time of the pitch.

In fastpitch, runners may try to steal bases by running to the next base
on the pitch and reaching it before being tagged with the ball. The
point at which a runner can steal a base varies. In fastpitch, the
runner is allowed to begin stealing a base when the ball is released
from the "windmill" pitching motion, but until recently, stealing was
forbidden in slow pitch because a runner has the opportunity to get a
larger head start while the slow pitch is making its way to the batter.
As a result of rule changes initiated by the Independent Softball
Association which later made its way to the Amateur Softball Association
and the International Softball Federation in the 21st century, most
levels of slow pitch permit stealing bases, provided the runner starts
when the ball either touches the ground or crosses the plate. This rule
encourages pitchers to be more responsible with the pitch and catchers
to play defense, as balls which miss the catcher are now grounds to have
stolen bases.^[33] <#cite_note-autogenerated1982-33>

No matter what level of play, all baserunners must keep one foot on a
base until the pitcher throws the ball or until the ball crosses the
front edge of home plate (depends on association).^[33]
<#cite_note-autogenerated1982-33>

In fastpitch, if the catcher drops strike three (a "passed ball") with
less than two outs, the batter can attempt to run to first base if first
base is unoccupied. The catcher must then attempt to throw the ball to
first base ahead of the runner. If he or she cannot, the runner is safe.
With two outs, the batter can attempt to run to first whether or not it
is already occupied.^[33] <#cite_note-autogenerated1982-33>

Depending on the league in slow pitch only a foul ball with two strikes
on the batter means the batter is out. Stealing in 16-inch softball is
severely restricted, as a runner may only steal the base in front of
them if it is open, and if they are thrown at, /à la/ pickoff move or
snap throw. This results in many inexperienced players being thrown or
doubled off when they attempt to advance on a wild pickoff at another
baserunner.^[33] <#cite_note-autogenerated1982-33>


      Scoring runs[edit
      <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Softball&action=edit&section=20>]

A "run" is scored when a player has touched all four bases in order,
proceeding counterclockwise around them. They need not be touched on the
same play; a batter may remain safely on a base while play proceeds and
attempt to advance on a later play.^[33] <#cite_note-autogenerated1982-33>

A run is not scored if the last out is a force out or occurs during the
same play that the runner crosses home plate. For instance, if a runner
is on third base prior to a hit, and he or she crosses home plate after
an out is made, either on the batter or another runner, the run is not
counted.^[33] <#cite_note-autogenerated1982-33>


      Ending the game[edit
      <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Softball&action=edit&section=21>]

The team with the most runs after seven innings wins the game. The last
(bottom) half of the seventh inning or any remaining part of the seventh
inning is not played if the team batting second is leading.

If the game is tied, play usually continues until a decision is reached,
by using the international tie-breaker rule or if time is expired the
score would be just tied. Starting in the top of the last inning, the
batting team starts with a base-runner on second base, which is the
player who is the last available to bat (in other words, the batter who
last took their position in the batter's box; regardless whether they
were the last out or another runner was put out).

In games where one team leads by a large margin, the run ahead rule
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercy_rule> may come into play in order
to avoid embarrassing weaker teams. In fastpitch and modified pitch, a
margin of 15 runs after three innings, 10 after four, or 7 after five is
sufficient for a win to be declared for the leading team. In slow pitch,
the margin is 20 runs after four innings or 15 after five innings.^[20]
<#cite_note-rules-20> In the NCAA
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association>, the
required margin after 5 innings is 8 runs. The mercy rule takes effect
at the end of an inning. Thus, if the team batting first is ahead by
enough runs for the rule to come into effect, the team batting second is
given their half of the inning to try to narrow the margin.

A game may be lost due to a "forfeit". A score of 7–0 for the team not
at fault is recorded (generally one run is awarded for each inning that
would have been played). A forfeit may be called due to any of these
circumstances: if a team does not show up to play; if one side refuses
to continue play; if a team fails to resume play after a suspension of
play ends; if a team uses tactics intended to unfairly delay or hasten
the game; if a player removed from the game does not leave within one
minute of being instructed to do so; if a player that cannot play enters
the game and one pitch has been thrown; if a team does not have, for
whatever reason, enough players to continue; or if after warning by the
umpire, a player continues to intentionally break the rules of the game.
This last rule is rarely enforced as players who break rules after being
warned are usually removed.

The plate umpire may suspend play because of darkness or anything that
puts players or spectators in danger. If five innings have been played,
the game is recorded as it stands. This includes ties. If fewer than
four innings have been played, the game is not considered a "regulation"
game.

Games that are not regulation or are regulation ties are resumed from
the point of suspension. If it is a championship game, it is replayed
from the beginning. Team rosters may be changed.


    Positions[edit
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Softball&action=edit&section=22>]

There are nine players out on the field at one time in fastpitch
softball and 10 players in slow-pitch softball. Although the pitcher and
catcher have the ball the most, each person has a specific job. In the
infield there is the pitcher, catcher, first baseman, second baseman,
shortstop, and third baseman. In the outfield there is a left fielder,
center fielder, and right fielder. In slow-pitch softball there is an
extra outfielder in the outfield, who is specified as a roamer or rover.
Normally, the defensive team will play with four outfielders, meaning
there is a left fielder, left-center fielder, right-center fielder, and
right fielder. The recent trend with tournament and league slow pitch
softball play is to field 5 infielders instead of 4 outfielders. The
extra infielder is commonly placed behind the pitcher on either side of
2nd base.


      Designated player[edit
      <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Softball&action=edit&section=23>]

In fastpitch softball, it is common for teams to use a designated player
in the lineup; this player, which functions like the designated hitter
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designated_hitter> in baseball, hits in
place of one of the position players but does not play defense.

Unlike a designated hitter, a designated player can also become a
temporary defensive substitute, and the player substituted by the
designated player can return to their original position at a later point
in the game. However, the only player that can be substituted as an
offensive replacement (pinch runner or pinch hitter) is the defensive
player the designated player originally replaced, known as the "flex".

At any time, the designated player can be substituted back into the
lineup in the place of the flex player, but once taken out, the
designated player cannot take the place of any other player in the
lineup.^[35] <#cite_note-35>


      Pitcher[edit
      <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Softball&action=edit&section=24>]

The pitcher <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher> is the individual
who throws the ball from the middle of the diamond. As in baseball,
fastpitch softball has a rubber used to control the pitchers delivery. A
pitcher must have both feet on the rubber at the start of their delivery
but neither foot is on the rubber when the ball is released. In
baseball, the rubber is on a mound of dirt as gravity is used to
generate speed. In softball, the pitchers throw from within a circle and
the rubber in the circle is not elevated. The circle is also used to
control base runners. When the pitcher is in possession of the ball in
the circle, a runner who has passed a base must either advance or return
to the base. They cannot "bait" the pitcher to throw or they will be
called out. The pitcher tries to throw the ball in the strike zone
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_zone>. In order to do that, they
start while having the ball in their glove, they throw their arms behind
their hips, they shoot forwards with their leg, which is on the same
side as their glove, and leave their glove hand there and the other arm
goes around the shoulder, bends the elbow, and turns their wrist toward
the 3rd baseman, and brings their arm through at the end, flicks their
wrist, and brings the arm up, with the hand by their shoulder. They
follow through with their legs turning their pitching stance into a
fielding stance. They try to release the ball when they go past their
hips. In softball, the pitcher uses an underarm motion to pitch the ball
towards the strike zone. As soon as the pitcher makes a throw, the
fielders are ready to field balls that are hit in the middle of the
diamond.^[36] <#cite_note-36> Pitchers usually tend to be tall, very
flexible and have good upper body strength. Pitchers can be righthanded
or lefthanded. The softball pitcher makes a windmill motion while
throwing underhand, unlike baseball pitchers who throw overhand.


      Catcher[edit
      <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Softball&action=edit&section=25>]

The catcher <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher> is normally behind
home plate in a squatted position
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squatted_position> (some plays may
require the catcher to stand at an angle for intentional walks). At the
plate the catcher is responsible for catching pitches, keeping
mispitched balls in front of the plate, calling pitches that are
normally done through hand signals, and they are considered the leaders
of the field. Catchers must know how many outs there are, the number of
strikes and balls on the batter so they can relay that to their
teammates. They must also know how many runners are on base and where
the ball should be thrown next in the following play. Catchers are
strong, need to be smart and quick on their feet, and have accurate
throws so they can pick runners off at each base. Catchers should be
able to have strong and muscular legs to squat for a long period of
time. The gear worn by a catcher protects them from balls thrown in the
dirt or wild pitches. The catcher is allowed to take off his/her mask to
catch a pop fly or to watch the play. The catchers gear can be very hot.
Some catchers wear pads under their knees to help keep the knees healthy.


      First baseman[edit
      <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Softball&action=edit&section=26>]

The first baseman <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman> is the
position to the left side of the diamond when facing home plate. The
major role of the first baseman is to receive throws from other
defensive players in order to get a force play
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_play> at first base. Another role
they play is to make fielding plays on all balls hit towards first base.
The first baseman is usually involved in every play that occurs on the
field. Individuals at first base have quick hands and good reach, and
are always on the lookout to catch the player off base. They are also
generally taller and left-handed throwing
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_basemen#left-handed_throwing_first_basemen>,
which gives them an extended reach. First basemen however, can be both
left and right handed. Just like the catcher, first basemen may wear
specific first base mitts
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softball#Gloves>, usually having a longer
web allowing them to reach the taller throws over their head.


      Second baseman[edit
      <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Softball&action=edit&section=27>]

The second baseman <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_baseman> plays
in between the first baseman and second base itself, usually closer to
second base. If the ball is hit to the left side of the field, the
second baseman covers second base. If the ball is hit to right-field or
center field, they become the cut-off for the center fielder or the
right fielder depending who the ball was hit to. If the ball is hit to
the first baseman, the second baseman then is responsible for covering
first. If the ball is hit to the second baseman, they either throw the
ball to second if there was already a player on first, or they throw to
first if there was nobody on. If there is a runner on first and the
person up to bat hits the ball to the shortstop or the third baseman,
the second baseman is in charge of covering second to receive the throw
from the shortstop or third baseman. Then, depending where the runner is
between home and first, the second baseman makes the decision to throw
the ball to first or to hold the ball. Also, in the case of a bunt, the
second baseman must cover first as the first baseman runs to get the
ball from the bunt, then it is often thrown back to first base.


      Shortstop[edit
      <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Softball&action=edit&section=28>]

The shortstop <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortstop> fields all balls
hit to the infield between the second and third bases. This individual
also helps cover second and third bases, is frequently involved in force
plays <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_play> and double plays
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_play>, and often throws the ball
to the catcher to throw out runners at home plate. On steals to second
base (when the runner from first is advancing to second on the pitch)
the shortstop usually covers. The shortstop doesn't cover second base
only when a right handed batter is up. In this case, the second baseman
covers the steal. Most short stops are very quick, agile and think fast.
Shortstops may play in a restricted zone but are faced with many types
of hits and interact closely with the 2nd base, 3rd base and home plate.
Often double plays are due to quick thinking/reaction by the short stop.
When a ball is hit up the middle and the shortstop catches it, they will
flip the ball to the second baseman for the best result. Shortstop also
takes the cut off for the left field when the play is at second base.
When the ball is hit to the right side of the outfield, the short stop
then covers second base. If there is a runner on first base and there is
a hit down the line or in the gap to right field, the shortstop will
then go for the cut to third. Meaning the runner that is going from
first to second will most likely be advancing to third, and in that
case, the shortstop will be the cut off for the throw from right field
to third base.^[37] <#cite_note-37> Shortstop can be one of the most
difficult positions to play due to the number of balls being hit in that
direction.


      Third baseman[edit
      <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Softball&action=edit&section=29>]

The third baseman <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_baseman> is the
position on the right side of the diamond when you are facing home
plate. They are responsible for fielding all balls hit their way
including bunts. In fact, the third baseman fields more bunts than a
pitcher and first baseman do. Third base is also called the "Hot Corner"
because the ball can pop off the bat at the fielder very fast. Third
baseman must have great reflexes and be very quick on their feet because
not only to they need to be quick to field a bunt but also if they are
unable to predict whether the batter will bunt or hit, a ball that is
hit may be a line drive to the face. It also helps if they can run fast
but it isn't a requirement. A third baseman must have a very strong arm
so that they can throw a runner out from across the diamond. Any ball
that the third baseman can get, they should. They will have more
momentum towards first base when fielding the ball than a shortstop.
They are also closer to first base when they cut off a slower ground
ball towards shortstop. Third baseman are responsible for covering third
base at all times unless the ball is hit to them. In that instance, the
shortstop is responsible for third base. Third baseman must be smart,
have great reflexes, have a strong arm, and be quick with their hands.


      Outfielders[edit
      <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Softball&action=edit&section=30>]

The outfielders <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielders> are players
that cover the grassy area behind the infield. Outfielders are named for
their positions in the field relative to home plate. Traditional
outfield positions include a left fielder, a center fielder, and a right
fielder. Each player has specific job as being an outfielder. In some
leagues and organizations, four outfield players are utilized by each
team, with the center field position being shared between two players
known as the left-center fielder and the right-center fielder (or,
alternatively, the deep center fielder and the short fielder).


        Right fielder[edit
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Softball&action=edit&section=31>]

The right fielder's position is on the right side of the field, behind
the first baseman, when looking at the field from behind home plate. The
right fielder is part of a group of two other fielders that make up the
outfield. The right fielder has a multitude of jobs over the course of a
softball game. Generally, outfielders act as a back-up to the infielders
when they make plays or if the ball is hit past the infield. Right field
has a particular job of covering the area behind first base if the ball
is to be thrown in that area. Right field is meant to cover this area is
the ball gets past the first baseman. This will prevent base-runners
from advancing to unwanted bases. Traditionally in the game of softball,
the right fielder will have the strongest arm out of the two other
outfielders. The right fielder must have the strongest arm because they
have the furthest possibility to throw the ball. A right fielder will
throw the ball to each base more than the other outfielders will because
of their position in respect to the bases.


        Center fielder[edit
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Softball&action=edit&section=32>]

The center fielder's position is in the middle of the outfield directly
behind second base when looking at the field from behind home plate. The
center fielder is part of a group of two other fielders that make up the
outfield. Center fielders technically serve as the "captains" of the
outfield. They are and should be the most vocal in effectively
communicating with their outfielders. Since the outfielders are further
apart from each other, it can be hard to hear each other. The center
fielder covers the area behind second base if the ball is going to be
thrown in that direction. By covering this area, if the ball does get
past the infielder, the center fielder can prevent base-runners from
advancing to unwanted bases. Within the game of softball, the center
fielder is traditionally the fastest of the three outfielders. The
center fielder needs to be the quickest because of the large area of
field they must cover. Besides being a quick player, the center fielder
must have a strong throwing arm because of the distance between the
player and home plate.


        Left fielder[edit
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Softball&action=edit&section=33>]

The left fielder's position is on the left side of the outfield behind
the third baseman when looking at the field from behind home plate. The
left fielder is part of a group of two other fielders that make up the
outfield. Generally, outfielders act as a back-up to the infielders when
they make plays or if the ball is hit past the infield. The left fielder
must field their position, but also cover the area behind third base if
a ball is thrown or hit in that direction. The left fielder covers this
area in the case that the ball will pass the infielders. The left
fielder can then prevent the base runner from advancing to unwanted
bases. Besides covering certain areas of the field, the left fielder
must be the smartest of the outfielders. In the left field position, the
player has full view of the field, the players, the base-runners, and
the batter. The left fielder must constantly be aware of the situation
on the field and know what must be done in different circumstances. More
advanced levels require the left fielder to be able to field the ball
during "slap hit" situations by playing shallow. Left fielders must also
play a role in any run down situation between third base and home plate
or back up any plays that happen at third base in case of an overthrow.


    Modification of rules[edit
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Softball&action=edit&section=34>]

One reason for the popularity of softball is the ease of modification of
its rules, thereby allowing the game to be adapted to a variety of skill
levels. For example, in some slow pitch softball leagues a batter starts
at bat with a count of one ball one strike. In some leagues, the number
of home runs that can be hit by a team are limited. In other leagues,
stealing of bases is prohibited. Some groups allow for a more defensive
game by making home plate a force out for first base. This reduces
scoring evenly on both sides, and allows for some margin of error.

Co-recreational leagues, where men and women play on the same team,
often adopt rules intended to reduce gender inequality, under the
assumption that men will be generally more powerful. For example, rules
may stipulate that there must be an equal number of men and women on the
team, or that batting order alternate male and female batters.^[38]
<#cite_note-38> Some leagues only require 3 women to play but they must
be present on the field at all times. In most co-ed or mixed gender
leagues there is something called an encroachment line. This requires
the outfielders to stay behind a line till the ball is hit. If an
outfielder passes in front of this line before the female batter hits a
fair ball, the batter will receive a single base or the result of the
play, and the base runners will advance accordingly. The line will be
180 feet from home plate.^[39] <#cite_note-39> One possible rule
requires male batters to "switch hit".^[40] <#cite_note-40> Some leagues
even use different balls for male and female batters.^[41]
<#cite_note-41> While these modified rules are common, there are
questions as to their place in modern adult sports.^[42] <#cite_note-42>

Some leagues require teams to use limited flight softballs. These
softballs, when hit, will not go as far as regular softballs. Other
leagues limit the number of runs which can be scored in an inning. Five
is a common limit.

By allowing these and other modifications, softball can be enjoyed by
children, teenagers, and adults. Senior leagues with players over the
age of 60 are not uncommon.

An example of a rule modification is the "offensive pitcher" (or "self
pitch") often found in informal games where the emphasis is on the
social rather than the competitive aspects of the game. The pitcher aids
the batter by attempting to give the easiest pitch to hit. There are no
walks, and a batter is normally given a fixed number of pitches to
attempt to hit (usually 3 or 4). The batter is considered to strike out
if the batter fails to hit the ball into fair territory after the given
number of pitches. The pitcher does not act as a fielder, and a rule is
often made that if a batted ball touches the pitcher, the batter is out.

In some leagues the number of pitches to walk or strikeout can be
reduced. For instance, one strike is an out, and two balls is a walk.
This is common in leagues where doubleheaders are played, or in late
season leagues when reduced daylight is an issue. It results in shorter
games, as players are more apt to swing, even at marginal pitches,
rather than risk striking out on one pitch.

Many leagues also include a second first base immediately adjacent to
the main one. This is usually orange and the batter running through
first base is supposed to run straight through it. This minimizes the
chances of a collision. By the same token some leagues have an alternate
home plate and rule that plays at home are always force plays. In these
cases there is typically a white line drawn approximately 1/3 of the way
down the baseline that is considered a point of no return. This is
designed to reduce the "Pickle" which can put a great strain on the
ankles and knees of older baserunners.

In the recent years, the NCAA rules^[3] <#cite_note-:0-3> changed when
concerning the batters feet while in the box. The rule now states that
as long as any part of the batter's foot is in the box the ball will
stay live. It is not until the batter's entire foot is out of the box,
that the play will be declared dead and the batter called out. The SEC
(college ball), however, claims that if any part of the batter's foot is
out of the box when she makes contact, she is out and the play is dead.


      Indoor play[edit
      <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Softball&action=edit&section=35>]

Despite the fact that it was originally intended to be played indoors,
softball is usually played outdoors. The indoor form is sometimes called
Arena Softball
<https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arena_Softball&action=edit&redlink=1>.
Indoor softball has generally the same rules as outdoor softball. Only
the wall behind the batter is considered foul territory. The other walls
are considered fair. Usually, there is a small area on one of the walls
in the outfield that results in a home run being awarded if the batted
ball hits it. Pitching is generally a little slower because of the
indoor turf, or pitched through a pitching machine at younger levels.
There is no limit to the number of batters a team may have available,
although only so many can bat in one inning. Some indoor facilities do
not allow the use of metal cleats on the field, which are what players
at the age of 14 and up generally use. Also, some tournaments may
require a time limit for games[2]

    Pitch[edit
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Softball&action=edit&section=36>]

^[43] <#cite_note-43> ^[44] <#cite_note-44> ^[45] <#cite_note-45> ^[46]
<#cite_note-46> ^[47] <#cite_note-47> ^[48] <#cite_note-48> ^[49]
<#cite_note-49> ^[50] <#cite_note-50> ^[51] <#cite_note-51>

In softball, a *pitch* is the act of throwing
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throwing> a softball
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softball#Ball> toward home plate to start
a play.

The phases of throwing include the grip, stance, windup, stride, release
and follow through.

Pitchers <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher> throw a variety of
pitches, each of which has a slightly different velocity, trajectory,
movement, hand position, wrist position and/or arm angle. These
variations are introduced to confuse the batter in various ways, and
ultimately aid the defensive team in getting the batter or baserunners
out. To obtain variety, and therefore enhance defensive baseball
strategy, the pitcher manipulates the grip on the ball
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softball#Ball> at the point of release.
Variations in the grip cause the seams to "catch" the air differently,
thereby changing the trajectory of the ball, making it harder for the
batter to hit.

The selection of which pitch to use can depend on a wide variety of
factors including the type of hitter who is being faced; whether there
are any base runners; how many outs have been made in the inning; and
the current score.


      Signaling[edit
      <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Softball&action=edit&section=37>]

The responsibility for selecting the type of pitch is traditionally made
by the catcher <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher> by relaying hand
signals to the pitcher with the fingers. In more advanced play, coaches
may give signs to batters and/or runners to initiate special plays in
certain situations. A catcher may signal to a position player that they
will be trying to throw the runner out. A runner on base may see the
pitch sign given by the catcher and hint it to the batter using hand or
body motions.


      Pitching styles[edit
      <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Softball&action=edit&section=38>]

The ISF
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Softball_Federation>
recognizes three pitching styles:

  * fastpitch <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastpitch_softball>
  * "modified" fastpitch
  * slowpitch <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softball#Pitching>


        Pitching styles of fastpitch softball[edit
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Softball&action=edit&section=39>]

The pitching distance can range between 35 and 43 feet. The pitches
travel at speeds of more than 65mph.

  * windmill or full windmill

    - The pitcher begins with her arm at the hip. Then she brings the
    ball in a circular motion over the head, completes the circle back
    down at the hip, and snaps the hand.

  * figure 8

    - The ball is not brought over the head at all but down and behind
    the body and back in one smooth motion tracing out a figure eight.

  * illegal forms of pitching
      o "crow-hopping"
      o "leaping"


        Pitching style of "modified" fastpitch softball[edit
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Softball&action=edit&section=40>]

  * "modified" windmill

    - A "modified" fastpitch is identical to a "windmill" pitch except
    the arm is not brought over the head in a full windmill motion, but
    instead is brought behind the body (restricted back swing) and is
    then thrust directly forward for the release.


        Pitching style of slowpitch softball[edit
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Softball&action=edit&section=41>]

The pitching distance is 50 feet. The pitch must be lofted in such a way
that it falls onto the plate in order for it to be a called strike (the
ball falls into the strike-zone instead of flying through). Strikeouts
are rare in slowpitch. Pitchers strategize to pitch the ball with a high
enough arc that the batter cannot hit a line-drive. The speed of the
pitches ranges from 25-35mph, resulting in plenty of reaction time.

  * half windmill

    - High-arc pitching technique
    - The pitch must be thrown with an arc between 6-12 feet high. If
    the arc is not high enough, the umpire will call the pitch illegal.


      Fastballs[edit
      <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Softball&action=edit&section=42>]

The fastball is the most common pitch in softball and easiest to learn.

  * Two-seam fastball <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-seam_fastball>
  * Four-seam fastball <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-seam_fastball>
  * Riseball (or "Dimple") <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riseball>
      o Two-seam riseball
      o Four-seam riseball

    - Most difficult pitch to learn and to teach.

  * Dropball
      o Basic drop
      o Half turn drop
      o Rollover (or "Snapover" or "Turnover" or "Over-the-top") drop
      o Peel (or "Lift-Up") drop

        - Some pitchers successfully develop both an off-speed and a
        full-speed peel drop.


      Off-speed pitches[edit
      <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Softball&action=edit&section=43>]


        Breaking balls[edit
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Softball&action=edit&section=44>]

  * Curveball
  * Screwball
  * Slider
  * Drop-curve
  * Rise-curve
  * Inside curve

    - Ball start off the plate on the inside and curves into the
    strikezone. The inside curve is frequently thrown at the batters
    hands so as to jam them forcing a foul hit.

  * Drop screw
  * Knuckle curve
  * Overhand curve


        Changeups[edit
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Softball&action=edit&section=45>]

The changeup is the staple off-speed pitch
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-speed_pitch>, usually thrown to look
like a fastball but arriving much slower to the plate. Its reduced speed
coupled with its deceptive delivery is meant to confuse the batter's
timing.

  * Dropchange
  * Flip (or "Back-hand flip") change

    - /most commonly used changeup/

  * Stiff wrist change
  * Circle changeup


        Other pitches[edit
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Softball&action=edit&section=46>]

  * Floater

    - This is the basic pitch that is used by most pitchers in the
    slow-pitch game. To throw the floater accurately, pitcher holds the
    ball with just hers fingertips and does not let them touch the
    laces. Then comes straight up with her hand and lets the ball go up
    to the 12-foot mark and come down. Knuckleball in baseball is
    sometimes called floater.

  * Knuckleball


      Pitching delivery[edit
      <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Softball&action=edit&section=47>]

Pitchers throw the ball with an *underhand* motion.


    International competition[edit
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Softball&action=edit&section=48>]

The International Softball Federation
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Softball_Federation> holds
world championships in several categories. The ISF is the international
governing body <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_governing_body>. The
Amateur Softball Association
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_Softball_Association> is the
National Governing Body of Softball for the United States pursuant to
the 1976 Amateur Sports Act. Due to the popularity of the sport, there
are a multitude of governing bodies such as the United States Specialty
Sports Association
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Specialty_Sports_Association>,
International Softball Congress
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Softball_Congress> and the
National Softball Association
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Softball_Association>.

The ISF holds world championship
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISF_Women%27s_World_Championship>
tournaments in several categories. The tournament in each category is
held every four years—two years from 2010. The most recent tournament
was XII Women's World Championship in June, 2010. All World
Championships use a Page playoff system
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_playoff_system>^[52]
<#cite_note-ISF_Technical_and_venue_manual-52> and are in fastpitch.
There are also several World Cups held at 4-year intervals in different
categories.^[53] <#cite_note-Past_results-53> ^[54]
<#cite_note-Calendar-54>

New Zealand are the current Men's World Champions, having won the title
in 2013. Prior to that, Australia won the World Championship in 2009 and
New Zealand had won the previous three tournaments before that.^[55]
<#cite_note-Men's_World_Championships-55> The current Junior Men's World
Champion is Argentina, having won the title in 2012.^[56]
<#cite_note-Junior_Men's_World_Championships-56> In the Women's World
Championships the United States is the most dominant team, having won
three of the past four Olympic tournaments
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softball_at_the_Summer_Olympics> and the
past seven World Championships.^[57]
<#cite_note-Women's_World_Championships_2006-57> ^[58]
<#cite_note-Women's_World_Championships-58> The current Junior Women's
World Champion is the United States.^[59] <#cite_note-Junior-59>

Women's softball made its first Olympic appearance in 1996 and made its
final Olympic appearance in the 2008 games.^[60] <#cite_note-60>
Softball and Baseball have both failed attempts to be reinstated to the
Olympics for 2012 and 2016. In 2012 the heads of the International
Softball and Baseball Federations announced they were uniting to
increase their chances in playing in the 2020 games."The proposal calls
for men's baseball and women's softball to be played at a single venue
over seven to 10 days. Each tournament would feature eight teams.
Baseball and softball would be two disciplines under a single sports
banner. The merger still requires formal approval from the congress of
both federations. Softball and baseball are competing with karate,
roller sports, squash, sports climbing, wakeboard and wushu for
inclusion in 2020. Only one spot on the Olympic program is open. The IOC
executive board will decide next May which sport to recommend for
inclusion. The final decision will be made in a vote of the full IOC in
Buenos Aires in September 2013.^[61] <#cite_note-61> ^[/needs update

      New Zealand[edit
      <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Softball&action=edit&section=49>]

New Zealand <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Socks> is the most
successful nation at men's world championship softball, having won their
seventh title in 2017. The New Zealand women's team
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_women%27s_national_softball_team>
have also won a number of World Championship titles in the past. The
game is widely played in New Zealand and is the second most popular
summer sport behind cricket.


      Australia[edit
      <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Softball&action=edit&section=50>]

Main article: Softball in Australia
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softball_in_Australia>

Softball is played in all states and territories in Australia and at all
levels of academic education. The game is widely promoted to maintain
fitness <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness>, health,
personal achievements and pleasure. Australia has excellent softball
teams which are a reflection of its coaching, education and training
system.^[62] <#cite_note-62>


      Japan[edit
      <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Softball&action=edit&section=51>]

Japan has had a long tradition of softball which is played at all levels
in the country. Many high schools and colleges have sports programs
which include softball. Like baseball, softball in Japan is intensely
competitive. Japan's win over the United States at the 2008
Olympics^[63] <#cite_note-63> reflects the advanced level of play in
this East Asian <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asia> country.


      China[edit
      <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Softball&action=edit&section=52>]

China is fast becoming the team to watch in softball. Since the silver
medal at the Atlanta Olympics
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996_Summer_Olympics>, the Chinese have
now made softball a priority at all levels.^[64] <#cite_note-64> The
game is played in most schools and with a 1.3 billion population; the
number of great players is turning out to be a boon for China. The
Chinese have frequently toured the US and have now similar caliber
coaching and training programs.


      Europe[edit
      <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Softball&action=edit&section=53>]

Softball is played in almost every country in Europe, mainly fastpitch.
Every two years an open women's European fastpitch championship
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESF_Women%27s_Championship> is held with
over twenty nationals teams. Italy and Netherlands are the best nations,
and both have an almost professional championship where athletes from
the US, Australia and China play. In the men's division eight to ten
national teams compete for the European championship
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESF_Men%27s_Championship>, with the Czech
Republic, the Netherlands and Denmark leading the way.


      United States[edit

It is estimated that 14.62 million Americans played at least one game of
softball during the spring of 2015.^[65] <#cite_note-65> It is played by
men and women both recreationally and competitively.

Softball is played, at some level, in over a hundred countries around
the world.^[66] <#cite_note-Softball_Australia_History-66> The
International Softball Federation has 113 member countries (excluding
dependent territories).^[67] <#cite_note-ISF_Directory-67>

In many^[/quantify
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers>/]
US cities, adult softball teams are organized by bars and clubs, hence
the popular term "beer league
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_league> softball". The teams can be
men's, women's or co-ed, and skill levels can range from novice to
elite, with league composition reflecting that. These leagues are
typically either slow-pitch or modified.^[/original research?
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research>/]

Competitive fastpitch softball
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastpitch_softball> for girls is growing
increasingly popular.^[/quantify
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers>/]
All over the US, there are thousands of teams that compete year-round at
tournaments. During most of these tournaments the biggest goal is not
winning the tournament, but attempting to get as many college coaches as
possible to observe (a) particular player or players. Competitive teams
are now beginning around eight years old, if not younger. Depending on
the team they can travel all over the United States or even out of the
country such as to Canada, the summer and fall for many weeks and days
at a time.^[/original research?
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research>/]

There are many different sanctioning bodies of softball: USSSA
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USSSA>, ASA, ISA, NSA, WSL, USFA, Triple
Crown and SASL just to name a few. One of the biggest is the Amateur
Softball Association
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_Softball_Association>, also known
as ASA. It is known as the national governing body of softball, was
established in 1933 and has over 240,000 teams. The USSSA
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USSSA>, founded in 1968 as the United
States Slo-Pitch Softball Association, but renamed in 1997 to the United
States Specialty Sports Association, is the only association that still
has a men's major slow-pitch program alive. Currently, the USSSA program
is run out of Viera, FL. The United States also has a competitive
women's softball team that competes in international tournaments. They
represented the US each time at the Olympics until softball was removed
from the Olympics.^[68] <#cite_note-68>

The USA Softball Men's Fast Pitch National Team has won five World
Championships (1966, 1968, 1976, 1980 and 1988) and three other medals.
In the Pan-American Games, Team USA has made the finals in all seven
appearances at the Games when Men's Fast Pitch was played.^[69]
