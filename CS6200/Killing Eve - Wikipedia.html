along a neighboring Berlin tramway street before entering a busy
nightclub, the location of which was Fabric
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabric_(club)>, opposite London's

Psychopathic Villanelle
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villanelle_(character)>—a young and
prolific assassin—leaves a trail of high-profile murders across several
countries. MI5 officer Eve Polastri
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eve_Polastri> connects a new
assassination in Vienna to a series of such killings which she has been
researching in her own time. Her theory that the assassin is a woman is
dismissed by her superiors, but her unauthorised interview with the only
witness confirms it. The witness is murdered while in a London hospital,
along with a nurse and two guards, causing MI5 to fire Eve and her
associate Bill. Impressed by Eve, Carolyn Martens, head of the Russia
Section of MI6, recruits her for an off-the-books assignment to track
the killer.

the murders may be the killer, and she recruits Elena and Bill as her
assistants. Villanelle forms a relationship with her neighbour Sebastien
and carries out another murder, of a successful parfumier, at a dinner
party in Paris.

    Use of fashion[edit
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Killing_Eve&action=edit&section=12>]

A pink tulle dress worn in the season 1 episode "I'll Deal with Him
Later <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%27ll_Deal_with_Him_Later>",
designed by Molly Goddard <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molly_Goddard>,
was heralded as a "fashion moment"^[58] <#cite_note-grazia-58> that
inspired the dresses worn on red carpets in the subsequent awards
season, including an overwhelming showing of pink at the 91st Academy
Awards <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/91st_Academy_Awards> in 2019.^[59]
<#cite_note-59> ^[60] <#cite_note-60> ^[61] <#cite_note-61> ^[62]
<#cite_note-62>

The show has had two costume designers
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costume_designer>; Phoebe de Gaye for the
first season and Charlotte Mitchell for the second.^[63]
<#cite_note-review-63>


      Villanelle[edit
      <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Killing_Eve&action=edit&section=13>]

The character Villanelle's (Jodie Comer) relationship to fashion has
been described by many people. Gilly Ferguson of /Grazia
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grazia>/ says that she has become a
"style icon".^[64] <#cite_note-64> Luke Jennings
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Jennings>, author of the book series
on which the show is based, says that "Clothes reflect her status and
independence[...] She doesn't have to conform or please anyone's gaze";
Charlotte Mitchell agrees that "She plays by her own rules".^[63]
<#cite_note-review-63> Sonia Saraiya of /Vanity Fair
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanity_Fair_(magazine)>/ considers
Villanelle's outfits "their own subplot"; she notes that the character
choosing to live in Paris <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris> is also
a nod to the fashion-centrism displayed.^[65] <#cite_note-VF-65> Melania
Hidalgo of /The Cut
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(magazine)#Digital_expansion_and_blogs>/
writes that "Villanelle reverses the style of a typical femme fatale,
wearing everyday basics on her missions while saving the chicest items
in her wardrobe for her days off";^[66] <#cite_note-thecut-66> in
reference to a specific outfit, Steff Yotka of /Vogue
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogue_(magazine)>/ says that Villanelle
has "redefined the look of an international assassin story" by
subverting classic tactical gear and sleekness.^[67]
<#cite_note-yotka-67> Mitchell also said of Villanelle that she "uses
color to provoke reactions", pointing to the pink Molly Goddard
dress.^[63] <#cite_note-review-63>


      Eve Polastri[edit
      <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Killing_Eve&action=edit&section=14>]

Considered Villanelle's fashion foil
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foil_(literature)> by /Entertainment
Weekly <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly>/, Eve
Polastri (Sandra Oh) has been described as considering fashion "trivial"
and not bothering to dress well. Jennings suggested that even if she
cared, "she'd be hopeless at it"; Mitchell and de Gaye crafted outfits
that match Eve's practical attitude, with Mitchell saying that she
"wears elastic waists [because] she doesn't have time to do up a button
fly".^[63] <#cite_note-review-63> Other choices include more clothes
made of linen <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linen> to more easily
appear dishevelled.^[63] <#cite_note-review-63> Eve is allowed some
moments of being well-dressed, however, which are significant to the
plot, including trying on dresses that Villanelle has chosen for her in
her own stolen suitcase.^[65] <#cite_note-VF-65>

        Season 1[edit
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Killing_Eve&action=edit&section=17>]

The first season of /Killing Eve/ received critical acclaim. On Rotten
Tomatoes <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes>, the first
season has an approval rating of 96% based on 95 reviews, with an
average rating of 8.28/10. The website's critical consensus reads,
"Seductive and surprising, /Killing Eve/'s twist on the spy vs. spy
concept rewards viewers with an audaciously entertaining show that
finally makes good use of Sandra Oh's talents."^[68] <#cite_note-68> On
Metacritic <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacritic>, it has a weighted
average score of 83 out of 100 based on 22 critics, indicating
"universal acclaim".^[69] <#cite_note-69>

Jenna Scherer, writing in /Rolling Stone
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone>/, described /Killing Eve/
as "hilarious, bloody, unclassifiable" and idiosyncratic, "a stylish
story of obsession and psychopathy
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathy> that's disarmingly warm and
lived-in".^[70] <#cite_note-RollingStone20180514-70> Scherer went on to
write that the show "undermines every rule of TV", with what it does
best being its "dry wit, razor-wire tension, sex appeal and the looming
threat of violence".^[70] <#cite_note-RollingStone20180514-70> Hanh
Nguyen wrote on IndieWire <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IndieWire> that
one of the show's most appealing aspects is "how it subverts
expectation", allowing it to "constantly surprise and delight".^[71]
<#cite_note-IndieWire20180506-71> Troy Patterson wrote in /The New
Yorker <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Yorker>/ that the story
discloses "a life independent of genre conventions" and that the triumph
of the show's style is its "reconciliation of the outlandish and the
intimate", adding that the "Jason Bourne
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Bourne>-style escapism of the bare
premise, inflected by the assertively odd tone, yields fresh depictions
of fear and grief".^[72] <#cite_note-NewYorker20180427-72> In the
context of /Vulture
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(magazine)#Digital_expansion_and_blogs>/'s
selection of Sandra Oh as the best actress on television (June 2018),
Matt Zoller Seitz <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Zoller_Seitz>
wrote that there was "no precedent" for the "wild extremes" of the
show's "comedy and thriller elements".^[73]
<#cite_note-Vulture20180627-73> While Mike Hale acknowledged in /The New
York Times <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times>/ that
"scenes and characterizations play out differently than we're used to"
and the comic style is distinctive, he also wrote – in contrast to most
reviewers – of being "just as conscious of (the show's) congruences with
standard examples of the genre ... as ... of the differences", citing
/Berlin Station
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Station_(TV_series)>, La Femme
Nikita <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Femme_Nikita>, Covert Affairs
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covert_Affairs>/ and /Homeland
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeland_(TV_series)>/.^[74]
<#cite_note-NYTimes20180405-74>

Scherer described the show as a feminine take on a traditionally
masculine genre—"more interested in giving space to character beats and
the weird chaos that can leak into the best-laid plans".^[70]
<#cite_note-RollingStone20180514-70> Similarly, Melanie McFarland wrote
for /Salon <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salon_(website)>/ that
/Killing Eve/ has been dubbed a "feminist thriller", calling it a
"perfect show for the #MeToo era
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Me_Too_movement>", saying that it "slakes
<https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/slake> one's desire to see piggish
misogynists get what's coming to them" but also delves into complex
trust issues among women and shows "sisterhood's might and peril (as)
powerful ... but ... also complicated and devoid of guarantees".^[75]
<#cite_note-Salon20180526-75> Along the same lines, Willa Paskin wrote
in /Slate <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate_(magazine)>/ that
/Killing Eve/ is a story about "the literal dangers of underestimating
women: of not seeing the woman who can kill you, underestimating the
woman who can stop her".^[76] <#cite_note-Slate20180410-76> Paskin added
that "The disfigured, beating heart of Killing Eve is the way that
Villanelle's gender and manner, her very femininity, keep our
acculturated brains from being appropriately terrified of her".^[76]
<#cite_note-Slate20180410-76>

Jia Tolentino acknowledged in /The New Yorker/ how critics have noted
that women characters are substituted for men "in every meaningful
part", that the men are "formulaic" but the women are "deeply
strange".^[77] <#cite_note-NewYorker20180527-77> However, Tolentino
asserted that /Killing Eve/ "isn't shaped around the concept of women;
it's shaped around /these/ women, who are unlike any others in their
wild, unlikely interior weirdness and flux".^[77]
<#cite_note-NewYorker20180527-77> She added that a defining feature of
the show is its "constant reversals in tone and rhythm", with the show's
thrill coming "from pattern rather than resolution".^[77]
<#cite_note-NewYorker20180527-77>

Ben Goldberg wrote in /Into/ that the series "never outright explains
its characters' sexualities, but unlike shows that queerbait
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queerbaiting> their audiences, /Killing
Eve/ does not need to name the relationship between Eve and Villanelle
in order to recognize it", adding that the show "does not shy away from
its characters' sexual attraction but also complicates this narrative at
every turn".^[78] <#cite_note-IntoMore20180702-78>

Hannah Giorgis wrote in /The Atlantic
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic>/ that the show's greatest
success is "how alluring it makes its villain: to both Eve ... and
audiences", and that Villanelle's character subverts feminine
stereotypes so as to "carve a jagged space into the serial-killer canon
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_(basic_principle)>".^[79]
<#cite_note-Atlantic20180528-79>


        Season 2[edit
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Killing_Eve&action=edit&section=18>]

The second season received critical acclaim. On Rotten Tomatoes, the
second season has an approval rating of 93% based on 57 reviews, with an
average rating of 8.2/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "With
the titillating cat-and-mouse game still rooted at its core, /Killing
Eve/ returns for an enthralling second season of considerably higher
stakes, hilariously dark humor and a captivating dynamic between
characters, solidifying its position as one of the best spy thrillers
out."^[80] <#cite_note-80> On Metacritic, it has a weighted average
score of 87 out of 100 based on 19 critics, indicating "universal
acclaim".^[81] <#cite_note-81>

Chitra Ramaswamy wrote in /The Guardian
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian>/ that the show "uproots the
tired old sexist tropes <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/trope> of spy
thrillers then repots them as feminist in-jokes, patriarchal piss-takes,
tasteless murders and blooms of sapphic
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapphic_love> chemistry".^[82]
<#cite_note-Guardian_20181012-82> Describing how Villanelle "does what
she always does—exploit society's misogyny
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misogyny> by imitating a victim of
it"—Emily Nussbaum wrote in /The New Yorker/ that the potent idea that
undergirds the show is that "femininity is /itself/ a sort of sociopathy
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathy#Sociopathy>, whose
performance, if you truly nail it, might be the source of ultimate
power".^[83] <#cite_note-NewYorker_20190422-83>

Angelica Jade Bastién wrote in /Vulture
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(magazine)>/ that the second
season, with new showrunner Emerald Fennell, "trades in the precise
mordant wit of series creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge for something more
garish and horrifying", further describing the "wild consumption" of
food and clothing "that builds into the closest thing the show has come
to a genuine sex scene between" the two women.^[84]
<#cite_note-Vulture_20190529-84> Bastién also perceived that "/Killing
Eve/ is deeply indebted to film noir
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_noir>, a genre whose backbone is the
ways people lose their soul in the face of desire—...but it's a noir
operating at the tenor of a fairy tale".^[84]
<#cite_note-Vulture_20190529-84>


        "Best of" lists[edit
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Killing_Eve&action=edit&section=19>]

Review aggregator Metacritic <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacritic>
reported in early December 2018 that more individual television critics
included /Killing Eve/ in their 2018 year-end Top Ten lists than any
other show.^[85] <#cite_note-Metacritic20181204-85>

In November 2018, /Killing Eve/ was chosen as /Time
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine)>/ magazine's Best Show of
2018, the magazine's Judy Berman writing that "the characters were
multidimensional but incomplete, their mutual obsession fueled by the
sense that each woman had something crucial the other lacked".^[86]
<#cite_note-TIME20181115-86> It was number three on /The New York Post
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post>'s/ Decider.com "Best TV
Shows of 2018" list, being praised for "brilliant writing" and "nuanced
performances".^[87] <#cite_note-Decider20181126-87> It was also second
on the "25 Best TV Shows of 2018" list from /Paste/ magazine
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paste_(magazine)>, which labeled it as
"the best new series of the year".^[88] <#cite_note-Paste20181127-88>

In December 2018, /The Guardian/ named /Killing Eve/ the best TV show of
2018, describing it as a "high-wire act of misdirection that subverted
stale genre expectations" and saying that it "mix[es] genres – spy
thriller, comedy, action film, workplace drama and... farce – without it
collapsing into a tonal mess".^[89] <#cite_note-Guardian20181220-89>
/The New York Times/ included /Killing Eve/ in its "Best TV Shows of
2018" list, stating that the series was "infused ... with the brio
<https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/brio> of a dark comedy, though its hour
length marked it as crime drama".^[90] <#cite_note-NYTimes20181203-90>
/The New York Times/ also included Oh's and Comer's performances in its
list of "Best Performances of 2018", noting "these two women are
inventive about how to be funny in a thriller" and "make run-of-the mill
embarrassment seem more lethal than any bullet".^[91]
<#cite_note-NYTimesBest20181207-91> NPR
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR> included the show on its list of
"Favorite TV Shows of 2018", saying that it may be "the strangest—and
most compelling—story of how opposites attract on TV this year".^[92]
<#cite_note-NPR20181217-92>

/The Washington Post
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post>/ listed /Killing
Eve/ as the third best show of 2018, calling the "sleeper hit...
splendidly paced".^[93] <#cite_note-WashPost20181227-93> /USA Today
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today>/ listed the show at fifth
place on its "Best TV Shows of 2018" list, remarking that it "completely
surprises you, from its writing to its performances to its direction to
the names on the poster".^[94] <#cite_note-USAToday20181206-94> /New
York <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(magazine)>/ magazine's pop
culture website Vulture <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulture_(blog)>
included the series as number seven on Jen Chaney's "10 Best TV Shows of
2018" list, remarking on its immediate and escalating "sense of
propulsive daring" and its infusion of "feminine energy".^[95]
<#cite_note-Vulture20181206-95> /TV Guide
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV_Guide>/ named Oh's and Comer's
performances as the second best TV performance of 2018, and said that
the show "ended up on pretty much everyone's Best of 2018 lists".^[96]
<#cite_note-TVguide20181203-96> /Vanity Fair
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanity_Fair_(magazine)>/ listed the show
at second place on its "Best TV Shows of 2018" list, saying that
"watching /Killing Eve/ is like spraying a disinfectant for the musty
tropes of prestige drama directly onto your brain" and inviting viewers
to "come for the black comedy; stay for the fashion".^[97]
<#cite_note-VanityFair20181204-97>

/Rolling Stone <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone>/ named the
show as the fourth best TV show of 2018, describing it as "exciting and
scary while making room for the quippy dialogue and smart observations
about how women interact".^[98] <#cite_note-RollingStone20181204-98>
IndieWire <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IndieWire> listed /Killing Eve/
as the fourth best new TV show of 2018, saying that "exploring identity
and dark desires, the series never met an impulse it didn't pursue to
its extreme", and that "outrageous and often off-kilter dark humor only
highlights the show's transgressive charms".^[99]
<#cite_note-IndieWire20181206-99> Livingly Media
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimbio> listed the series as the third
best TV show of 2018, saying it is "loaded with quippy dialogue and
razor-sharp observations about how women interact in increasingly

four on its "Best New TV Shows of 2018" list, praising the two lead
