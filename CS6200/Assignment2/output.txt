marriage
between
closely

under

which
early
canon
law
of
the
catholic
church
followed 
couples
were
forbidden
to
marry
if
they
were
within
four
degrees
of
consanguinity
in
the
ninth
century
the
church
raised
the
number
of
prohibited
degrees
to
seven
and
changed
the
method
by
which
they
were
calculated
eventually
the
nobility
became
too
interrelated
to
marry
as
the
pool
of
non
prospective
spouses
became
smaller
they
had
to
either
defy
the
church
position
or
look
elsewhere
for
eligible
marriage
candidates
in
1215
the
fourth
lateran
council
made
what
they
believed
was
a
necessary
change
to
canon
law
reducing
the
number
of
prohibited
degrees
of
consanguinity
from
seven
back
to
four
the
method
of
calculating
prohibited
degrees
was
changed
also
instead
of
the
former
practice
of
counting
up
to
the
common
ancestor
then
down
to
the
proposed
spouse 
the
new
law
computed
consanguinity
by
counting
back
to
the
common
ancestor
in
the
roman
catholic
church
unknowingly
marrying
a
closely
consanguineous
blood
relative
was
grounds
for
a
declaration
of
nullity
but
during
the
eleventh
and
twelfth
centuries
dispensations
were
granted
with
increasing
frequency
due
to
the
thousands
of
persons
encompassed
in
the
prohibition
at
seven
degrees
and
the
hardships
this
posed
for
finding
potential
spouses
after
1215 
the
general
rule
was
that
while
fourth
cousins
could
marry
without
dispensation 
generally
the
need
for
dispensations
was
greatly
reduced
in
fourteenth
century
england 
for
example 
papal
dispensations
for
annulments
due
to
consanguinity
affinity
were
relatively
few
the
connotations
of
degree
of
consanguinity
varies
by
context 
though
most
cultures
define
a
degree
of
consanguinity
within
which
sexual
interrelationships
are
regarded
as
incestuous
or
the
prohibited
degree
of
kinship
among
the
christian
habesha
highlanders
of
ethiopia
and
eritrea
predominantly
orthodox
christian
amhara
and
tigray
it
is
a
tradition
to
be
able
to
recount
one
paternal
ancestors
at
least
seven
generations
away
starting
from
early
childhood 
because
those
with
a
common
patrilineal
ancestor
less
than
seven
generations
away
are
considered
and
sister
and
may
not
marry
the
rule
is
less
strict
on
the
mother
side 
where
the
limit
is
about
four
generations
back 
but
still
determined
patrilinearly
this
rule
does
not

within

side
is
a
consanguineous
marriage
which
can
lead
to
many
gestational
and
genetic
problems
in
the

so
it
has
become
a
common
practice
in

say
that

globally 
the

europe
edit
historically 
some
european
nobles
cited
a
close
degree
of
consanguinity
when
they
required
convenient
grounds
for
divorce 
especially
in
contexts
where
religious
doctrine
forbade
the
voluntary
dissolution
of
an
unhappy
or
childless
marriage
conversely 
the

muslim
countries
edit
in
the
arab
world
today
when
the
practice
of
marrying
relatives
is
common
according
to
the
centre
for
arabic
genomic
research 
between
40
and
54
of
uae
nationals
marriages
are
between
family
members 
up
from
39
in
the
previous
generation
between
21
and
28
of
marriages
of
uae
nationals
were
between
first
cousins
consanguineous
marriage
is
much
less
prevalent
in
christian
arabs
as
they
do
not
practice
arranged
marriages
additionally 
an
indult
dispensation
is
required
to
marriages
contracted
between
first
cousins
or
closer
in
arab
christian
denominations
in
communion
with
the
roman
catholic
church
and
the
greek
orthodox
church
there
are
no
similar
regulations
that
apply
to
first
marriages
in
the
coptic
orthodox
church
in
egypt 
around
40
of
the
population
marry
a
cousin
a
1992
survey
in
jordan
found
that
32
were
married
to
a
first
cousin
a
further
17
were
married
to
more
distant
relatives
67
of
marriages
in
saudi
arabia
are
between
close
relatives
as
are
54
of
all
marriages
in
kuwait
whereas
18
of
all
lebanese
were
between
blood
relatives
the
incidence
of
consanguinity
was
54
among
kuwaiti
natives
and
higher
among
bedouins
it
has
been
estimated
that
55
of
marriages
between
pakistani
muslim
immigrants
in
the
united
kingdom
are
between
first
cousins 
where
preferential
patrilateral
parallel
cousin
marriage
i
a

of
his

is

double
first
cousins
are
descended
from
two
pairs
of
siblings 
and
have
the
same
genetic

as
half
in
unions
between
double
first

the

genetic
disorders
edit
further
information
inbreeding
the
phenomenon
of
inbreeding
increases
the
level
of
homozygotes
for
autosomal
genetic
disorders
and
generally
leads
to
a
decreased
biological
fitness
of
a
population
known
as
inbreeding
depression
a
major
objective
in
clinical
studies
while
the
risks
of
inbreeding
are
well
informing
minority
group
families
with
a
tradition
of
endogamy
and
changing
their
behavior
is
a
challenging
task
for
genetic
counseling
in
the
health
care
system
the
offspring
of
consanguineous
relationships
are
at
greater
risk
of
certain
genetic
disorders
autosomal
recessive
disorders
occur
in
individuals
who
are
homozygous
for
a
particular
recessive
gene
mutation
this
means
that
they
carry
two
copies
alleles
of
the
same
gene
except
in
certain
rare
circumstances
mutations
or
uniparental
disomy
both
parents
of
an
individual
with
such
a
disorder
will
be
carriers
of
the
gene
such
carriers
are
not
affected
and
will
not
display
any
signs
that
they
are
carriers 
and
so
may
be
unaware
that
they
carry
the
mutated
gene
as
relatives
share
a
proportion
of
their
genes 
it
is
much
more
likely
that
related
parents
will
be
carriers
of
an
autosomal
recessive
gene 
and
therefore
their
children
are
at
a
higher
risk
of
an
autosomal
recessive
disorder
the
extent
to
which
the
risk
increases
depends
on
the
degree
of
genetic
relationship
between
the
parents
so
the
risk
is
greater
in
mating
relationships
where
the
parents
are
close
relatives 
but
for
relationships
between
more
distant
relatives 
such
as
second
cousins 
the
risk
is
lower
still
greater
than
the
general
population
consanguinity
in
a
population
increases
its
susceptibility

infectious
pathogens

as
tuberculosis

in

this

was
one
of
the
most

prominence
in

within

of
the
dutch
east
indies 
fashion
played
an
important
role
to
define
ones
status
and
social
class
the
european
colonials
wore
european
fashion
straight
out
of
the
netherlands

even
paris 
while
the
natives
wore
their
traditional
clothings
that
are
distinct
in

regions
as
the
years
progressed
and
the
dutch
influence
became
stronger 
many
natives
began
mixing
european
styles
within
their
traditional
clothing
high
natives
within
the
colony
as
well
as
nobility 
would
wear
european
style
suits
with
their
batik
sarongs
for
special
occasions
and
even
for
everyday
use
more
and
more
native
indonesians
began
to
dress
more
european
this
of
course
came
with
the
idea
that
those
who
wore
european
clothing
were
more
progressive
and
open
towards
a
european
society
and
the
etiquette
that
came
with
it
more
and
more
the
european
influence
was
gaining
precedence
within
native
indonesians
this
probably
stems
from
the
fact
that
many
natives
were
treated
better
if
they
wore
european
clothing
their
european
counterparts
acknowledged
them 
and
that
in
turn
was
most
likely
a
catalyst
for
adoption
western

too
influenced
the
european
colonials
for
example 
the
thick

considered

thus 
the
light

of

many
surviving
colonial
families
and
their
descendants
who
moved
back
to
the

after
independence
tended
to
look
back
on
the
colonial

with
a
sense
of
the
power
and
prestige
they
had
in

has
a

the

of
an

united
states
edit
most
states
in
the
united
states
follow
the
common
law
which
permits
name
changing
for
non
purposes
this
is
actually
the
most
common
method 
since
most
women
who
marry
do
not
petition
a
court
under
the
statutorily
prescribed
method 
but
simply
use
a
new
name
the
husband
a
custom
which
started
under
the
theory
of
coverture
where
a
woman
lost
her
identity
and
most
rights
when
she
married
most
state
courts
have
held
that
a
legally
assumed
name
for
a
non
purpose
is
a
legal
name
and
usable
as
their
true
name 
though
assumed
names
are
often
not
considered
the
person
technically
true
name
the

general
edit
the
portuguese
naming
system
is
quite
flexible
portuguese
law
establishes
the
need
for
a
child
to
have
at
least
one
given
name
and
one
last
name
from
one
of
the
parents
the
law
also
establishes
the
maximum
number
of
names
allowed
up
to
two
given
names
and
four
surnames
this
restriction
is
generally
not
enforced
and
it
is
not
uncommon
to
have
more
than
four
surnames
citation
needed
usually 
the
maternal
surnames
precede
the
paternal
ones 
but
the
opposite
is
also
possible
if
the
father
is
unknown 
or
he
has
not
acknowledged
the
child 
only
the
mother
family
name
is
used
a
child
can
receive
surnames
from
their
parents
ancestors 
even
if
those
surnames
are
not
part
of
the
parents
names 
provided
that
the
parents
prove
those
names
were
used
by
their
ancestors
most
portuguese
people
use
only
their
last
surname
the
paternal
one
in
their
daily
and
professional
life
the
regular
usage
of
a
middle
surname
or
of
a
combination
of
two
surnames
is
also
widespread
some
portuguese
family
names
are
made
of
two
words 
most
often
not
hyphenated 
but
are
not
composite
names 
as
they
were
not
the
result
of
combining
two
family
names
in
past
generations
instead 
the
words
constitute
a
single
logical
unit
these
include
toponyms
castelo
branco
religious
references
esp
santo 
santa
rita
or
other
expressions
corte
real 
mil
in
this
case
both
words
must
be
cited
writer
camilo
castelo
branco
is
never
referred
to
as
camilo
branco
number
of
names
edit
it
is
not
uncommon
in
portugal
that
a
married
woman
has
two
given
names
and
six
surnames 
two
from
her
mother
family 
two
from
her
father
family 
and
the
last
two
coming
from
her
husband
in
addition 
some
of
these
names
may
be
made
of
more
than
one
word 
so
that
a
full
feminine
name
can
have
more
than
12
words
for
instance 
the
name
maria
do
carmo
m
de
ferro
e
cunha
de
almeida
santa
rita
santos
abreu
would
not
be
surprising
in
a
married
woman
m
de
ferro
hand
and
santa
rita
saint
rita
of
cascia
count
only
as
one
surname
each
in
this
case 
santos
abreu
would
probably
have
come
from
this
woman
husband
in
portugal 
the
custom
of
giving
a
child
four
last
names
is
becoming
popular 
since
this
way
a
child
can
have
each
of
their
grandparents
last
names
in
portugal
and
brazil 
some
people
view
this
as
a
sign
of
snobbery
since
it
used
to
be
the
noble
families
who
had
a
large
number
of
given
names
for
instance 
the
emperor
pedro
i
of
brazil
known
as
pedro
iv
of
portugal
had
the
full
name
of
pedro
de
alc
francisco
ant
jo
carlos
xavier
de
paula
miguel
rafael
joaquim
jos
gonzaga
pascoal
cipriano
serafim
de
bourbon
e
bragan
and
his
son 
the
emperor
pedro
ii
of
brazil
had
the
full
name
of
pedro
de
alc
jo
carlos
leopoldo
salvador
bibiano
francisco
xavier
de
paula
leoc
miguel
gabriel
rafael
gonzaga
de
habsburgo
e
bragan
for
the
sake
of
simplicity 
most
portuguese
people
use
only
two
surnames
for
example 
if
jos
santos
almeida
and
maria
abreu
melo
had
a
daughter 
her
name
could
simply
be
joana
melo
almeida
name
mother
last
name
father
last
name
however 
they
could
give
her
two
given
names 
for
example
joana
gabriela
and
combine
their
surnames
in
various
ways 
such
has
joana
gabriela
melo
almeida
joana
gabriela
abreu
melo
almeida
surnames
from
the
mother 
one
from
the
father
joana
gabriela
abreu
santos
almeida
name
from
the
mother 
two
from
the
father
or
even
joana
gabriela
abreu
melo
santos
almeida
names
from
each
parent
it
would
also
be
possible
to
use
surnames
that
are
not
part
of
either
parent
legal
name 
but
which
the
parents
would
be
entitled
to
use 
i
a
surname
from
a
grandparent
or
a
great
that
was
not
transmitted
to
the
father
or
the
mother
this
child
would
probably
become
known
by
her
final
surname 
joana
almeida
however 
her
parents
could
decide
to
change
the
order
of
surnames
and
name
her
joana
almeida
melo
etc
in
this
case
she
would
probably
be
known
as
joana
melo
in
portugal 
having
only
one
surname
is
rare 
and
it
usually
happens
when
both
the
parents
have
the
same
last
name 
to
avoid
repetitive
combinations
such
as
ant
santos
santos
would 
however 
be
an
acceptable
legal
name
in
brazil 
having
only
one
surname
is
common
in
areas
with
large
communities
of
non

edit
portuguese
names
have
a
standard
spelling 
since
names
are
considered
as
regular
nouns
and
are
thus
subject
to
the
orthographical
rules
of
the
portuguese
language
the
spelling
of
many
names
has
evolved
through
times
and
with
orthography
reforms
at
the
same
time 
archaic
forms
of
names
survive 
though
they
are
considered
misspellings

very
common

double

not
unusual
to
find
masculine
names
such
as
jo

in
this
case 
maria

fashionable

surname
and
marriage
edit
the
custom
of
a
woman
adopting
a
different
surname
through
marriage
is
not
a
portuguese
tradition
citation
needed
it
spread
in
the
late
19th
century
in
the
upper
classes 
under
french
influence
citation
needed
after
the
1940s 
it
became
almost
socially
obligatory
not
doing
so
was
seen
as
evidence
of
concubinage 
particularly
until
the
1970s
there
is
no
longer
a
distinct
pattern 
with
men
and
women
being
allowed
to
choose
whether
to
change
or
not
their
surname
in
portugal
a
person
may
adopt
his
or
her
spouse
surname
but
each
always
keeps
the
original
birth
surnames
for
example 
if
maria
abreu
melo
marries
jos
santos
almeida
she
could
choose
to
become
maria
abreu
melo
almeida
or
maria
abreu
melo
santos
almeida
in
brazil 
a
woman
may
adopt
her
husband
surname
and
choose
to
keep
or
exclude
her
birth
names
for
example 
when
maria
abreu
melo
marries
jos
santos
almeida
she
could
choose
to
become
maria
abreu
melo
almeida
maria
abreu
melo
santos
almeida
maria
santos
almeida
maria
almeida
etc
usually 
in
these
cases 
a
woman
keeps
part
of
her
birth
name
and
uses
part
of
her
husband
surname 
in
order
to
avoid
having
long
names
so 
the
most
used
combination
from
the
above
example
would
be
maria
melo
almeida
the
mandatory
adoption
of
the
new
name
led
to
unusual
combinations 
as
in
the
uncommon
case
of
both
spouses
having
the
same
surname 
when
the
woman
surname
was
kept
another
confusing
situation
was 
for
example
when
a
woman
named
ana
lima
silva
married
a
man
named
jo
lima
her
name
could
legally
become
ana
lima
silva
lima
in
portugal 
since
1977 
and
in
brazil
since
the
1970s 
a
woman
has
the
option
of
whether
or
not
to
change
her
name
after
marriage
in
portugal 
since
1977 
and
in
brazil 
since
2002 
a
husband
can
also
adopt
his
wife
surname
in
portugal 
when
this
happens 
usually
both
spouses
change
their
name
after
marriage
example 
jos
santos
almeida
and
maria
abreu
melo
could
become
jos
santos
melo
almeida
and
maria
abreu
melo
almeida
or
even
jos
santos
almeida
melo
and
maria
abreu
melo
almeida
in
brazil 
there
is
not
yet
a
perceived
pattern
in
2012 
a
circuit
of
the
superior
court
of
justice
in
brazil
allowed
a
woman
to
adopt
her
male
partner
surname
while
in
a
civil
union
collation
edit
when
producing
alphabetized
lists
of
portuguese
names 
generally
the
full
name
is
used
this
occurs
mainly
in
schools
or
official
documents 
and
it
is
usually
done
because
many
people
prefer
to
use
multiple
surname
combinations
in
their
daily
life 
or
do
not
use
the
last
surname
at
all
it
is
therefore
difficult
to
order
people
by
the
surnames
they
use
a
typical
alphabetized
list
however 
in
areas
such
as
a
telephone
directory
or
bibliography 
the
practice
of
using
the
surname
is
preferred
the
conjunctives
and
affixes
preceding
or
following
it 
such
as
da
and
filho
are
not
used
when
a
full
composite
surname
is
known 
it
is
alphabetized
according
to
the
first
name
even
if
not
separated
by
a
hyphen
when
it
is
not
known 
the
last
name
should
be
used
because
of
this 
many
errors
are
committed
in
the
alphabetization
of
portuguese
surnames 
such
as
in
a
telephone
directory
for
example
these
rules
may
change
if
the
portuguese
name
has
been
absorbed
into
a
different
culture 
as
in
english
countries
in
the
united
states
for
example 
where
many
portuguese
have
emigrated
since
the
18th
century
to
rhode
island
massachusetts
connecticut
california
hawaii
new
jersey
and
new
hampshire
alphabetising
rules
use
da
and
de
as
part
of
the
surname

portuguese
author
john
dos
passos
who
is
referred
to
as
having
the
surname
dos
passos 
is
a
good
example
nicknames
edit
portuguese
nicknames
are
usually
formed
by
inserting
the
diminutive
infix
inh
or
it
before
the
final
vowel
in
the
name
for
example 
teresa
becomes
teresinha
little
teresa
and
carlos
becomes
carlinhos
little
carlos
in
some
cases 
a
nickname
is
formed
by
adding
zinho
or
to
the
actual
name
for
example 
jo
becomes
jo
little
jo
or
sofia
becomes
sofiazinha
little
sofia
augmentative
suffixes
may
be
used
as
well 
with
marcos
becoming
marc
big
mark
for
example
other
practices
include
the
repetition
of

patterns

children

edit
in

recent
immigrants
especially
italians 
germans 
jews
and
japanese
usually
give
their
sons
only
the
father
family
surname
although
there
is
no
legal
restriction
on
this
practice 
the
pattern
in
succeeding
generations
changes
to
the
traditional
portuguese
pattern 
usually
because
of
assimilation
today
one
can
find
people
who
use
two
italian
surnames
gardi
bianchini
or
two
japanese
surnames
sugahara
uemura
a
practice
that
is
unusual
in
italy
and
nonexistent
in
japan
having
two
surnames
from
different
non
origin
is
also
not
uncommon 
such
as
the
brazilian
celebrity
sabrina
sato
rahal
a
japanese
and
an
arab
surname 
respectively
particularly
common
are
german
combinations
bianchini 
for
instance
especially
in
rio
grande
do
sul
the
spanish
pattern
is
to
use
both
the
father
and
mother
family
surnames 
but
in
reverse
order
compared
to
portuguese
pattern
almost
all
of
the
first
spanish
born
generation
were
named
in
order
of
the
family
surnames
of
the
portuguese
pattern
s
paulo
state
area
edit
a
specific
pattern
developed
among
the
descendants
of
20th
immigrants
they
use
only
their
father
surname
and
two
given
names 
the
first
is
a
portuguese
given
name
and
the
second
one
is
a
given
name
from
their
father
original
country
this
pattern
is
most
used
among
japanese
and
syrian
lebanese
immigrants
sons
and
grandsons
so
one
can
find
names
like
paulo
salim
maluf
where
paulo
is
a
portuguese
given
name 
salim
is
an
arabian
given
name 
and
maluf
is
his
father
surname
or
maria
heiko
sugahara
where
maria
is
a
portuguese
given
name 
heiko
a
japanese
given
name
and
sugahara
is
her
father
surname
this
practice
allows
the
person
to
be
recognized
as
paulo
maluf
or
maria
sugahara
the
large
brazilian
society
or
as
salim
maluf
or
heiko
sugahara
the
immigrant
social
community
this
pattern
used
to
be
quite
common
in
s
paulo
intermarriage
has
reduced
this
practice 
but
it
is
commonly
used
when
both
father
and
mother
belong
to
the
same
ethnicity
younger
generations
tend
to
use
both
the
father
and
the
mother
family
name

giving
four
names
to
their
sons

have
a
patronymical 
locative
or
religious
origin
surnames
originating
from
patronymics
edit
patronymics
are
names
derived
from
the
father
given
name
that 
many
centuries
ago 
began
to
be
used
as
surnames
they
are
a
common
form
of
surnames
in
the
lands
where
portuguese
is
spoken
and
also
have
developed
in
many
other
languages
in
portuguese 
patronymics
are
surnames
such
as
henriques
pires
rodrigues
lopes
nunes
mendes
fernandes
gon
arantes
esteves
and
where
the
ending
means
son
of
some
surnames
that
originated
in
this
way
do
not
end
in
es
instead
they
end
in
iz
like
muniz
son
of
monio
and
ruiz 
son
of
ruy
or
ins
like
martins
son
of
martim
although
most
portuguese
surnames
ending
in
are
former
patronymics 
some
family
names
with
endings
are
not
patronymics 
but
toponymics 
such
as
tavares 
cort
and
chaves
some
surnames
are
equal
to
given
names 
such
as
joana
fernando
or
andr
jo
in
which
fernando
and
jo
are
surnames 
not
given
names
it
is
rather
improbable
that
those
are
patronymics
more
likely
they
originated
with
people
with
no
surnames 
who
were
given
two
names
for
the
sake
of
enhanced
individuality
one
can
find
today
in
portugal
and
brazil
people
who
still
use
surnames
that
for
other
people
are
just
given
names 
although
they
were
passed
from
parents
to
sons
for
generations 
such
as
valentim 
alexandre 
fernando 
afonso
the
family
name
de
melo
afonso
and
antonio
de
melo
antonio
names
like
dinis
duarte
garcia
and
godinho
were
originally
given
names 
but
today
they
are
used
in
brazil
almost
exclusively
as
surnames 
although
duarte
and
dinis
are
still
common
given
names
in
portugal
matronymics
derived
from
female
given
names
are
not
used
in
portuguese
surnames
such
as
catarino
catarina
and
mariano
related
to
maria
are
rather
references
to
catholic
saints
originating
with
the
practice
of
giving
a
child
the
name
of
the
saint
of
the
day
in
which
he
or
she
was
born
citation
needed
some
former
patronymics
are
not
easily
recognized 
for
two
main
reasons
sometimes
the
given
name
that
was
the
basis
of
the
patronymic
became
archaic 
such
as
lopo
basis
of
lopes
mendo
or
mem
mendes
vasco
vasques
soeiro
soares
munio
muniz
sancho
sanches
also 
often
the
given
names
or
the
related
patronymic
changed
through
centuries 
although
always
some
resemblance
can
still
be
noted
such
as
antunes
of
ant
or
antonio
peres
of
pero
archaic
form
of
pedro
alves
alvares
son
of

eanes
mediaeval
iohannes 
son

the
question

portuguese
jewish
surnames
edit
it
is
a
popular
belief
citation

that
the
jews
living
in
portugal
up
to
1497 
when
they
were
forced
to
choose
between
conversion

expulsion 
substituted
their
surnames

the
names
of
trees
that
do
not
bear
edible
fruits

citation

as
denoting

ancestry
is
esp
santo
spirit

holy
ghost
and
verdugo
of

the
rationale
is
that
jews
would
adopt
as
a
family
name
an
christian
concept
as
a
deception
in
fact 
they
were
choosing
the
most
incorporeal
trinity
person 
that
is 
the
one
that
offended
least
their
jewish
faith
this
theory
is
not
totally
unfounded

there
is
evidence
that
the
cult
around
the
holy
spirit
flourished
after
1496 
especially
among
new
christians
this
does
not
rule
out
that
esp
santo
was
also
adopted
by
faithful
christians 
following
the
rationale
of
other

brazilian
surnames
edit
giving
portuguese
surnames
to
afro
and
native
brazilians
edit
until
abolition
of
slavery 
slaves
did
not
have
surnames 
only
given
names
citation
needed
they
were
even
forbidden
to
use
their
distinct
african
or
native
brazilian
names
and
were
christened
with
a
portuguese
given
name
while
slavery
persisted 
slaves
needed
to
have
distinct
names
only
within
the
plantation
fazenda
or
engenho
to
which
they
belonged
it
was
a
common
practice
to
name
free
slaves
after
their
former
owners 
so
all
their
descendants
have
the
portuguese
surnames
of
their
former
owner
citation
needed
indigenous
people
who
were
not
slaves
also
chose
to
use
their
godparents
surnames
as
their
own
citation
needed
religious
names
are
also
more
common
among
people
with
african
or
native
brazilian
ancestors
than
among
people
with
only
european
ancestors
a
slave
who
had
just
a
given
name
like
francisco
de
assis
saint
francis
of
assisi
could
use
the
partial
name
de
assis
as
a
surname 
since
the
connective
de
gives
the
appearance
of
surname
the
practice
of
naming
afro
with
religious
surnames
was
proved
even
by
some
indirect
approaches
medical
researchers
demonstrated
that
there
is
a
statistical
correlation
between
a
religious
name
and
genetic
diseases
related
to
african
ancestry
such
as
the
sickle
disease
due
to
miscegenation
the
correlation
exists
even
among
white
people
that
have
religious
surnames
citation
needed
it
was
also
common
to
name
indigenous
people
and
freed
slaves
with
surnames
which
were
already
very
common
such
as
silva
or
costa
that
is
why
citation
needed
silva
is
the
most
common
surname
in
brazil
surnames
originated
from
native
brazilian
words
edit
in
the
years
following
brazil
independence 
some
old
brazilians
families
changed
their
surnames
to
surnames
derived
from
tupian
languages
as
a
patriotic
way
to
emphasize
the
new
fatherland
some
of
these
names
are
still
spelled
with
portuguese
old
orthography
but
some
are
spelled
according
to
the
new

these

brazilian
surnames

some
old

locative

that
denote
the
original

the
ancestor
who
first
used
it
was
born
or
lived
like
surnames
that

this

some

named
after
a
location 
as
in
europe 
generally
owned
by
the
notable
at
their
death 
the
family
in
order
to
maintain
the
reference
to
the
title
would
adopt
them 
to
the
point
that
many
brazilians
still

these

immigrants
surnames
edit
although
not
so
widely
used
as
in
the
united

immigrants
used
to
change
their
surname
to
show
assimilation

to
avoid
social
discrimination
in
brazil
this
practice
was
most
used
during

ii
by
italian
immigrants
because
italy
was
an
enemy
country
for
a
few
years

as
italians

catholics

were
easily
assimilated

society 
the
practice
is
not
perceived
and
almost
forgot
after
a
single
generation
the
new

surname
was
generally
chosen
based
on
the
original
meaning
of
the
foreign
surname
olivetto

oliveira
sometimes
the
new

in

although
an
american

by
the
press 
this
practice
was
used
in
brazil
as
a
much
more
respectful
treatment
and
never
in
a
formal
way
some
sociologists
who
have
suggested
that
members
of
the
brazilian
upper
classes
were
often
raised
by
slave
women
who
called
them
using
a
hypocoristics 
and
that
childish

continued
to
be
used

in

8
divisions
and
2
districts
the
divisions
were
areas
near

were
areas
further

in
1927 
suriname

the
country
was
divided
into
7
districts
in

1948 
1949 
1952
and
1959
further
small
modifications

igbo
name
from
wikipedia 
the
free
encyclopedia
igbo
names
are
traditionally
and
historically
constructed
in
a
fashion
similar
to
arabic
naming
convention
old
european
naming
in
this
convention
there
are
no
family
names 
instead
one
is
known
through
their
immediate
male
lineage
in
the
olden
days 
igbos
men
and
women
were
named
after
the
four
market
days
orie 
afor 
and
nkwo
in
igboland
examples
mgb
mgborie 
nwanyinkw

and

women

the
man
are

naming
edit
in
the
igbo
naming
convention
a
child
is
given
a
name
at
birth
referencing
an
event
surrounding
the
birth 
a
deceased
ancestor 
or
the
time
and
place
of
birth
this
is
the
name
they
will
primarily
be
known
by
to
differentiate
from
others
in
the
same
generation
with
the
same
name
a
person
will
also
give
their
father
first
name
the
first
westerners
to
communicate
with
the
igbo
often
confused
this
for
a
surname
name
however 
unlike
a
surname 
it
is
not
passed
on
to
the
next
generation
as
a
second
name
this
system
extended
even
into
marriage
unlike
in
some
western
countries 
the
woman
does
not
always
change
her
name
in
the
event
that
she
did 
it
would
be
to
her
husband
first
name
in
the
example
above 
the
progenitors 
onodugo
and
nkechi
may
be
differentiated
from
others
in
their
generation
by
his
and
her
father
name
for
ex
onodugo
and
nkechi
have
fathers
with
first
names
okonkwo
and
agu
respectively
they
are
the
father
and
mother
of
a
daughter 
and
son
who
are
each
married
the
son
and
daughter
each
had
a
child
the
first
who
had
a
child
would
name
their
child
ezenwa
the
next
sibling
to
have
a
child
would
almost
always
give
their
child
a
different
first
name
it
is
against
custom
to
name
a
child
after
a
living
family
member 
especially
one
in
the
same
or
previous
generation
ezenwa
and
his
cousin
would
each
get
their
fathers
first
name
for
their
last
after
marriage 
nkechi 
adanna
and
oluchi
are
known
either
by
their
fathers
or
husbands
first
names
in
the
beginning
and
middle
of
the
20th
century 
after
the
spread
of
christianity
this
method
was
almost
completely
dropped
in
favor
of
adopting
the
grandfather
name
last
name
as
a
surname
in
many
cases 
either
an
english
name

hebraization
of
surnames
from
wikipedia 
the
free
encyclopedia
poster
offering
assistance
in
choosing
a
hebrew
name
the
hebraization
of
surnames
hebraicization
hebrew
ivrut
hebraization
is
the
act
of
adopting
a
hebrew
surname
in
exchange
for
a
diaspora
name
for
many
diaspora
jews
who
migrated
to
the
land
of
israel
taking
a
hebrew
surname
was
a
way
to
erase
remnants
of
their
diaspora
experience
and
to
assimilate
into
a
new
shared
jewish
identity
with
mizrahi
jews
and
palestinian
jews
residents
of
ottoman
palestine
and
mandatory
palestine
and
later
as
israeli
jews
citizens
of
the
independent
state
of
israel
this
name
typically
did
not
apply
to
mizrahi
jews
who
came
from
neighboring
countries
such
as
iran 
iraq 
and
egypt
mizrahis
usually
kept
their
surnames
this
phenomenon
was
especially
common
among
ashkenazi
jews
because
many
such
families
only
acquired
permanent
surnames
than
patronyms
when
surnames
were
made
compulsory
by
the
november
12 
1787
decree
by
the
habsburg
emperor
joseph
ii
sephardi
jews
from
the
iberian
peninsula
often
had
hereditary
family
names
since
well
before
the
spanish
expulsion
cordovero 
abrabanel 
shaltiel 
de
leon 
alcalai 
toledano 
etc
very
few
hebrew
surnames
existed
before
hebraization 
such
as
cohen
moss
and
levi
levite
several
hebrew
surnames 
such
as
katz
bogoraz
ohl
and
pak
are
in
fact
hebrew
acronyms
even
though
they
sound
and
are
often
perceived
as
being
of
non
origin
these
cases 
from
german 
russian
polish
and
korean
respectively
hebraization
began
as
early
as
the
days
of
the
first
and
second
aliyot
and
continued
after
the
establishment
of
the
state
of
israel
the
widespread
trend
towards
hebraization
of
surnames
in
the
days
of
the
yishuv
and
immediately
after
the
establishment
of
the
state
of
israel
was
based
on
the
claim
that
a
hebrew
name
provided
a
feeling
of
belonging
to
the
new
state
there
was
also
the
wish
to
distance
from
the
lost
and
dead
past 
and
from
the
forced
imposition
of
foreign
german
names
in
the
previous
centuries
this
process
has
not
ended
among
the
thousands
of
israelis
who
currently
apply
for
legal
name
changes
each
year 
many
do
it
to
adopt
hebrew
names
a
similar
phenomenon
was
observed
with
latvian
surnames
their
de
germanization
as
part
of
the
latvian
national
movement
during
the
interbellum

edit
in
the
yishuv
edit
among
the
yishuv
first
to
return
to
eretz
yisrael
land
of
israel
there
was
a
strong
feeling
of
sh
ha
negation
of
the
diaspora
which
often
included
the
exchange
of
diaspora
surnames
for
purely
hebrew
ones
part
of
the
zionist
movement
was
not
only
aliyah
it
was
also
wanting
to
create
an
image
of
an
israeli
jew
that
would
be
different
from
the
stereotypical
perception
of
yiddish
shtetl
weak
diaspora
jews
and
these
things
were
a
significant
part
of
the
people
of
the
first
and
second
aliyot
some
of
the
immigrants
of
the
first
aliyah
hebraized
their
surnames 
and
the
practice
became
widespread
during
the
second
aliyah
jewish
agency

edit
this
process
started
with
individuals
like
eliezer
ben
and
was
adopted
by
the
new
yishuv
before
the
founding
of
the
state
of
israel 
in
1944 
the
zionist
leadership
and
the

after

of
israel
edit
after
the
israeli
declaration
of
independence
there
was
still
the
attitude
that
the
hebraization
of
family
names
should
continue 
in
order
to
get
rid
of
names
with
a
diaspora
sound
hebraization
of
names
became
a
typical
part
of
the
integration
process
for
new
immigrants
among
ashkenazi
jews
but
also
among
sephardi
and
mizrahi
jewish
immigrants
from
arab
and
muslim
lands
sephardi
and
mizrahi
children
were
typically
given
new
hebrew
names
in
school 
often
without
permission
from
their
parents
david
ben
the
first
prime
minister
of
israel
was
committed
to
the
use
of
the
hebrew
language
changed
his
surname
from
gr
to
ben
he
tried
to
convince
as
many
people
to
change
their
surnames
into
real
hebrew
ones
ben
got
herzl
rosenblum
to
sign
the
israeli
declaration
of

as
herzl
vardi 
his
pen
name
changed
to
his
legal
name
as
ben
wanted
more
hebrew
names
on
the
document
nine
more
of
the
signatories
of
the
document
would
then
go
on
to
hebraize
their
name 
as
well
ben
in
an
order
to
the
israel
defense
forces
soldiers 
wrote 
it
is
desirable
that
every
commanding
officer
squadron
commander
to
chief
of
staff
should
change
his
surname 
whether
german 
english 
slavic 
french
or
foreign
in
general 
to
a
hebrew
surname 
in
order
to
be
a
role
model
for
his
soldiers
the
israel
defense
forces
must
be
hebrew
in
spirit 
vision 
and
in
all
internal
and
external
expressions
a
binding
order
of
the
same
issue
was
issued
to
the
officials
of
the
state
in
1950 
and
particularly
to
those
who
represented
the
state
abroad
a
committee
for
hebrew
names
was
established
to
supervise
the
implementation
of
the
order 
whose
task
was
to
assist
and
advise
the
choice
of
a
hebrew
name
in
addition
to
pressure
from
the
state 
tensions
between
jewish
ethnic
groups
caused
some
people
to
hebraize
their
names
to
dis
with
a
stigmatized
ethnic
group
or
to
merge
into
a
collective
israeli
identity
and
therefore
created
a
desire
to
hebraize
supporters
and
opponents
edit
the
hebraization
of
surnames
was
a
source
of
debate
in
the
days
of
the
yishuv
and
after
the
establishment
of
the
state
of
israel
supporters
edit
among
the
most
significant
supporters
was
yitzhak
ben
zvi
leader
of
the
labor
movement
historian
and
second
president
of
the
state
of
israel
he
was
born
in
ukraine
on
24
november
1884
he
studied
law
in
istanbul
together
with
david
ben
gurion
in
1906
he
attended
the
founding
conference
of
the
poalei
zion
and
in
1907
he
settled
in
the
land
of
israel
he
belonged
to
the
founders
of
the
ahdut
ha
party 
was
active
in
the
haganah
a
member
of
the
jewish
national
council
and
signed
the
israeli
declaration

independence
ben
zvi
died
in
1963
ben
zvi
wrote
our
surnames
are
mostly
of
foreign
origin 
which
cling
to
exile
even
names
based
on
hebrew
first
names
were
damaged
and
distorted
from
the
original
by
german
and
english
suffixes 
like
son
or
sohn
and
the
slavic
in
ovich
ovsky
and
shvili
these
surnames
fill
the
air
and
the
pages
of
our
newspaper 
the
posters
and
announcements
in
our
streets
and
public
squares
it
is
indeed
not
really
clear
if
the
hardship
of
this
inheritance
which
remained
with
us
as
a
result
of
the
middle
ages
and
subsequent
ghettoization
should
be

one
of
the
opponents
of
the
hebraization
of
surnames
was
moses
calvary
a
writer
and
teacher
born
in
germany
1883 
he
received
a
traditional 
general 
and
rabbinical
education
he
was
a
member
of
ahdut
ha
an
educator
in
the
meir
shfeya

village 
principal
of
gymnasia
rehavia
in

bialik
yitzhak
ben
zvi
demands
we
disqualify
all
the
foreign
names
which
are
close
to
us
his
assumption
was
that
our
immigration
to
eretz
yisrael
is
a
revolutionary
act 
a
return
to
one
origins
let
the
memory
of
the
diaspora
therefore
be
erased
so
that
the
crown
be
returned
to
ancient
times 
by
wrapping
our
names
in
the
envelope
of
our
language
i
have
my
doubts
if
this
zealousness
is
appropriate
our
names
are
part
significant
part
our
history
bearers
of
historical
names
are
still
alive
and
among
us
the
names
of
figures
who
mark
our
history
like
sasportas
or
benbenisti 
abrabanel
or
don
yehia 
rappaport
or
eibeschitz
is
no
reason
to
delete
the
chronicle
of
our
national
life
let
us
preserve
the
faith
of
our
fathers
also
in
our
revival
do
not
betray
our
memories
by
radical
action
and
the
text
does
not
only
relate
to
the
famous
the
variety
in
our
names
is
a
sign
of
our
colorful
history 
a
two
year
history 
whose
traces
cannot
be
wiped
out
light
moses

some
people
were
emotionally
attached
to
their
diaspora
last
name 
for
reasons
such
as
it
having
noble
origins
hebrew
yichus
or
for
a
desire
to
continue
to
identify
with
their
ethnic
group
there
is
story
of
an
israeli
diplomat
who
told
david
ben
i
will
change
my
name
if
you
can
find
me
one
non
named
lifshitz
others
had
names
that
were
entirely
hebrew
to
begin
with
the
disagreement
about
the
hebraization
of
surnames
continued
many
people
preserved
their
foreign
surname 
such
as
first
president
of
israel
chaim
weizmann
president
of
the
supreme
court
of
israel
shimon
agranat
and
others
decline
of
hebraization
edit
this
trend
moderated
with
time
by
the
time
of
the
wave
of
immigration
from
the
former
soviet
union
in
the
1990s 
the
practice
was
waning
the
soviet
immigration
wave
clearly
had
the
effect
of
weakening
the
practice
of
hebraizing
names
part
of
the
marked
general
tendency
of
these
immigrants
to
cling
to
their
specific
russian
linguistic
and
cultural
identity
a
conspicuous
example
is
the
former
israeli
minister
of
tourism 
stas
misezhnikov
though
an
outspoken
israeli
nationalist
on
other
issues 
misezhnikov
did
not
feel
impelled
to
change
his
clearly
slavic
surname
his
equally
slavic
first
name
and
there
was
no
public
pressure
on
him
to
do
so
there
would
have
been
on
an
israeli
minister
during
the
country
first
decades
however 
even
today 
people
continue
to
hebraize
their
surname 
especially
those
serving
in
the
idf
and
israel
diplomatic
missions 
representing
the
state
of
israel
the
number
of
those
who
do
is
small
but
significant
about
15
of
american
and
british
immigrants
to
israel
who
come
on
nefesh
b
flights
hebraize
their
names
on
arrival
there
is
also
a
trend
of
reverting
to
ancestral 
non
names
to
return
to
one
roots
and
preserve
traditions
unique
to
each
ethnic
group
there
are
people
who
re
the
name
their
family
previously
abandoned
for
the
sake
of
israeliness
such
as
israeli
writer
yitzhak
orpaz
who
restored

sometimes

its

the
